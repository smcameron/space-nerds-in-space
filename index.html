<hr>
<font size=+1>
<p><b>Space Nerds In Space</b> is an open source (GPLv2) cooperative multiplayer
starship simulator for linux (may also work on Mac).
So go out and get together with a crew of your linux-nerd friends and their computers
in a room with a projector or TV, and go forth and explore the galaxy.

<p>One computer runs the central server simulation of the game's universe.  Each player's
computer acts as a station on a simulated spaceship.  There are stations for
<b>Navigation, Weapons, Engineering, Communications, Damage Control,</b> and <b>the "Main View",</b>
an out-the-window 3d rendering.  Multiple starships each with their own team may
connect to the server for bridge-vs-bridge combat, or for cooperative play.  Additionally,
a game master may inject and control various NPC ships into the game to entertain the
players, and scenarios may be constructed with a Lua based scripting API.
<p>You might be reminded of <a href="https://artemisspaceshipbridge.com/">Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator</a>,
and you would not be out of line, as this game was the inspiration for Space Nerds In Space.
Within a month after mentioning Space Nerds In Space publicly, and before I'd gotten very far
at all, but about the time I realized that what I was working on might be more than vapor, I
wrote to Thom Roberts, expressing my desire to write a linux based spaceship bridge
simulator with essentially the same <em>raison d'etra</em> as Artemis (though differing
radically in the details), and he replied:

<blockquote>
I can think of no greater flattery, especially since I've seen other games that made ME want to make my own version.

Good luck!
</blockquote>

<p>And so I proceeded.

<p>If you're on mobile, you would probably have a better time viewing this site on a real computer.

hackerspace of Houston, TX, TX/RX Labs</a>, camera work and editing by Jack Younger.
This is from 2013, and the graphics and other aspects of the game are much better now,
but this video will still give you a good idea of what the game is all about.

<p>Space Nerds In Space was designed with hackerspaces in mind -- where else are you going to
find enough people to run a linux-based multi-player LAN game spaceship simulator for Star Trek
nerds but a hackerspace?  The <a href="http://i.imgur.com/jPffJyj.png">very first 3D model</a> created
for Space Nerds In Space may seem <a href="https://twitter.com/cbase">strikingly familiar</a>.
If you're a member of a hackerspace, this game is explicitly <em>made for you</em>.

<h1><a name="flatpak">Appimage and Flatpak</a></h1>
<p>If you don't wish to build SNIS yourself (though I must stress, building it
yourself is <em>not difficult</em>), Github user and (presumably) SNIS fan
Vince Pelss has compiled SNIS into Appimage and Flatpak forms. These may be found here:
<ul>
<li>Flatpak: <a href="https://github.com/vpelss/snis_flatpak">https://github.com/vpelss/snis_flatpak</a>
<li>Appimage: <a href="https://github.com/vpelss/Space-Nerds-In-Space-Appimage">https://github.com/vpelss/Space-Nerds-In-Space-Appimage</a>
</ul>

<h1><a name="buildinstructions">Build Instructions</a></h1>

<p>Here's a quick preview of the build instructions detailed below:
<ol start="0">
<li>Acquire necessary hardware (some linux machines, network switch, cables, projector, stereo, etc.)
<li>Clone git repository or obtain source tarball and unpack it.
<li>Install dependencies (run <cmd>util/install_dependencies</cmd> on apt-based systems)
<li>Build the code (type "<cmd>make<cmd>")
<li>Download additional art assets (type "<cmd>make update-assets</cmd>")
<li>Run the game (type "<cmd>bin/snis_launcher</cmd>")
</ol>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCokfUtZOqw">(Here is a long, boring video demonstrating how to install)</a>

<h2>Step 0: Acquire Hardware and OS</h2>
<p>This is a linux game.  You will need a computer running linux that has
a reasonably decent GPU.  A Raspberry Pi 4 (with 4Gb RAM) and heatsinks is
sufficiently powerful to run the game at 720p for <em>some</em> screens, namely NAVIGATION,
ENGINEERING, DAMAGE CONTROL, SCIENCE and COMMS, but is <em>not</em> really good enough
for the MAIN VIEW, WEAPONS, or DEMON screens (you'll see very low FPS).
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdy4ICZqc68">Here is a long boring
youtube video demonstrating installation and running SNIS on a Raspberry Pi 4B</a>
if you want to see for yourself what it's like.
Older Raspberry Pis
are generally <em>not</em> powerful enough to run the game.

<p>It is possible to run the game entirely on a single linux laptop, but for the full and
proper spaceship experience you will want six linux computers, a network switch,
a projector or large TV, and a stereo system for audio in a reasonably dark
room.

<p>The game is currently developed using <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/">Mint 17.3</a>
It is within the realm of possibility that the game could be made to build
and work on Mac OSX (it has been done before, but not since 2014 or so.)
You're on your own if you want to try to run it on Mac, and my understanding
is that newer Macs don't support OpenGL, which means you're out of luck.

<h2>Step 1: Download the Source Code</h2>

<p>The source code is here:
<a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space">Space Nerds In Space github page</a>
<p><b>NOTE: Do <e>NOT</em> perform these steps as root!</b>
<p>To get the source code, there are three methods:
<ul>
<li>If you are a registered github user, type (as a non-root user):
<pre>
<blockquote>
git clone git@github.com:smcameron/space-nerds-in-space.git
<blockquote>
</pre>
<li>If not a registered github user, you can still use git with https.  Type (as a non-root user):
<pre>
<blockquote>
git clone https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space.git
<blockquote>
</pre>
<li>Finally, you can just download a snapshot zipfile without using git at all:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/archive/master.zip">
https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/archive/master.zip</a>
</ul>
<p>After downloading the zip file, you must unpack the zip file.  Type (as a non-root user):
<pre>
<blockquote>
unzip space-nerds-in-space-master.zip
cd space-nerds-in-space-master
</blockquote>
</ul>

<h2>Step 2: Install Dependencies</h2>
<p>There is a script, <cmd>util/install_dependencies</cmd>. In theory it can install dependencies
on apt, yum, zypper, or rpm based systems, but it has only been tried with apt based
systems. If you want to see what it will do without actually doing anything, it has
a <cmd>--dry-run</cmd> option.
<blockquote>
<cmd>util/install_dependencies</cmd>
</blockquote>
If you don't want to run this script, or find that it does not work for you, you can
install the dependencies manually, as described below. If <cmd>util/install_dependencies</cmd>
performs its job satisfactorily, you can advance to Step 3.
<pre>
<blockquote>
sudo apt-get install build-essential;
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev;
sudo apt-get install libpng-dev;
sudo apt-get install libvorbis-dev;
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev;
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0-0;
sudo apt-get install liblua5.2-dev;
sudo apt-get install libglew-dev;
sudo apt-get install libttspico-utils; # optional, for text to speech
sudo apt-get install sox; # for "play" command, used by text to speech
sudo apt-get install libcrypt-dev; # used by bin/snis_update_assets
sudo apt-get install libcurl-dev; # used by bin/snis_update_assets

# (The following are optional)

sudo apt-get install espeak; # optional alternative to libttspico-utils
sudo apt-get install alsa-utils; # optional alternative to sox, for "aplay" command
sudo apt-get install openscad; # optional, only needed if you intend to work on 3D models.
                # Also, it is recommended to get it from http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html
                # as the version in the repos tends to be out of date.
sudo apt-get install git; # Version control, useful if you're hacking on the game
sudo apt-get install stgit; # Useful for making patches if you're hacking on the game. It's like "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quilt_(software)">quilt</a>"
but on top of git.
</blockquote>
</pre>

<p>If you want to try the optional pocketsphinx based local speech recognition,
you will want the following packages:
<pre>
<blockquote>
sudo apt-get install pocketsphinx-utils;
sudo apt-get install pocketsphinx-lm-en-hub4;
sudo apt-get install pocketsphinx-lm-en-hub4;
sudo apt-get install libpocketsphinx1;
</blockquote>
</pre>

<p>The above list may be incomplete, and these are the package names on mint 17.3 / ubuntu,
so may be different on RPM based systems.

<p class="tab">
<div class="boxed">
<p class="tab">NOTE: Later, the Makefile will download the Opus library source (
https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/opus/opus-1.3.1.tar.gz).  This library is used
for the voice chat feature. If you intend to build on a machine which does not
have internet access, or for whatever reason do not want the makefile to download
this library at build time, you can download it yourself beforehand. Or you can
modify the Makefile and change "WITHVOICECHAT=yes" at the top of the file to
"WITHVOICECHAT=no" and it will not download this library (and you won't have the
voice chat feature.)
</p>
</div>

<p class="tab">
<div class="boxed">
<p class="tab">NOTE: problems building on SuSE Leap 15.1. The following problems/solutions have
been conveyed to me regarding SuSE Leap 15.1. This information is not very complete or
accurate, but it is the best I have for now.  Please feel free to send me
improvements to these instructions.
See <a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/issues/222">
Bug 222</a>.
<ol>
<li>Need to install pkg-config and pkg-config_files.
<li>Need to set pkg-config-path environment variable
<li>All references to lua 5.2 in the Makefile need to be changed to lua 5.3.
Note, we only compiled snis_client (via "make bin/snis_client") which shouldn't
need lua at all. I don't know if the differences between lua 5.3 and lua 5.2 are
significant enough to break things. I normally use lua 5.2 on my systems.
<a href="http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/readme.html#changes">Changes to Lua 5.3</a>
-- at a quick glance I didn't see anything that I think will
be problematic.
</ol>
</p>
</div>
</p>

<h2>Step 3: Build the Code</h2>
<p>To build the code, make sure you are in the top level
directory for the game ("space-nerds-in-space" if you
got the source using git, or "space-nerds-in-space-master" if you
downloaded the zip file), and type (as a non-root user):

<pre><blockquote>
make
</blockquote></pre>
<p>You should see quite a lot of output, like this:
<pre>
<blockquote>
  COMPILE mathutils.c
  COMPILE snis_alloc.c
  COMPILE snis_socket_io.c

... many steps omitted here ...

  LINK bin/snis_server
  LINK bin/snis_client
  LINK bin/snis_limited_client
  LINK bin/snis_multiverse
</blockquote>
</pre>

<p>If you have problems building the code, it likely means there is some
missing dependency.  Double check that you have all the required dependencies
installed.

<p>You can also file a bug report if you think you have discovered a problem
with the build process, or the instructions here.  I believe you will need a github
account to file a bug report.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/issues">Click here to file a bug report</a>.
</ul>

<h2>Step 4: build openscad models (optional, not recommended)</h2>
<p>Or you can skip to step 5 and just download the models instead (recommended).
This step will take a long time and requires that you installed OpenSCAD.
In general, unless you are working on the models, you can and should skip this step.
(Again, as a non-root user):
<pre>
<blockquote>
  make models
</blockquote>
</pre>
Note: If you intend to run the game without downloading aditional assets
(step 5, below), with just the default assets, this can be done, but
requires the additional step of running:
<pre>
<blockquote>
  bin/snis_update_assets --force --destdir ~/.local/share/space-nerds-in-space --srcdir ./share/snis
</blockquote>
</pre>
to copy assets into ~/.local/share/space-nerds-in-space.
<h2><a name="additionalassets">Step 5: Download additional assets</a></h2>
<p>If you skipped step 4 and didn't build the openscad models, they will be downloaded
in this step, along with some other things. This step requires an internet connection.
If you performed step 4, you may skip this step though it is not recommended,
as you will be missing some additional solarsystem assets. As a non-root user:
<pre>
<blockquote>
  bin/snis_launcher
</blockquote>
</pre>
Then choose option 8, "Check for asset updates and set up assets".  This will copy assets
to (by default) into $HOME/.local/share/space-nerds-in-space/ and download additional assets
over the internet.

<h2><a name="singlemachineinstructions">Step 6. Run the Game on a single system (Try this before trying multiplayer)</a></h2>
<p>Type (as a non-root user):
<blockquote>
<pre>
    $ bin/snis_launcher

         Welcome to Space Nerds In Space

    ------------------------------------------------------------
    No SNIS processes are currently running.

       1. Launch SNIS lobby server
	    The lobby server allows clients to find servers
	    There should be one lobby server total.
       2. Launch SNIS multiverse server
	    The multiverse server stores player ship data
	    There should be one multiverse server total
       3. Launch SNIS server
	    There should be one snis server per solarsystem.
	    There should be at least one instance of snis_server.
       4. Launch SNIS client process
	    There should be one snis client process per player
	    plus one more per ship for the main screen.
       5. Launch limited SNIS client process (no Open GL required).
       6. Stop all SNIS processes
       7. Stop all SNIS clients
       8. Stop all SNIS servers
       9. Check for asset updates
       10. Enter Lobby Host IP addr (currently localhost)
       0. Quit
       Choose [0-10]: _
</pre>
<p>Choose option 1, then option 2, then option 3, then option 4 (taking defaults for
any questions you might be asked.)
</blockquote>
<p>
After awhile, you should see a screen that looks something like this:
<p align=center><img src="network-setup.jpg", width=85%, alt="Image of a typical network setup">

<ol>
<li>Click on the MAIN SCREEN ROLE checkbox to be sure it is checked.
<li>The <em>very first</em> time you run it, leave the CREATE SHIP box
checked.  On subsequent runs, make sure CREATE SHIP is not checked.
<li>Enter the name of your ship in the "SHIP NAME" field.
<li>Choose a password for your ship and enter it in the PASSWORD field.
(Note: the passwords are not cryptographically secure.)
<li>Click the "ENTER LOBBY ..." button in the lower left part of the screen
</ol>
<p>Once connected to the lobby, you should see something like this:
<p align=center><img src="lobby1.jpg", width=85%, alt="Image of the lobby screen">
<p>Click on the white text "KARADO".  When you do that, you should see:
<p align=center><img src="lobby2.jpg", width=85%, "Image of the lobby screen with selection made">
<p>Click on the "CONNECT TO SERVER" button on the right side of the screen.
After you do that, you should briefly see this:
<p align=center><img src="connecting.jpg", "Image of connecting screen">
<p>and then this should quickly be replaced be an "out the window" view
of space, as below, the "main screen" view of Space Nerds In Space.  It may not look
exactly like this as your ship will be placed in a semi-random location facing
an arbitrary direction.  If you've gotten this far, congratulations, you're doing
better than most.
<p align=center><img src="out-the-window.jpg", width=85%, alt="Image of out the window view">
<h2>Step 6. Play around</h2>
<h3><a name="controls">Keyboard Controls</b></h3>
<p>The function keys are used to switch between screens, except for F1, which is the 'help' key.
<ul>
<li>F1 is the help screen.  What it displays depends on which screen you're on.
<li>F2 - NAVIGATION
<li>F3 - WEAPONS
<li>F4 - ENGINEERING
<li>F5 - DAMAGE CONTROL
<li>F6 - SCIENCE
<li>F7 - COMMUNICATIONS
<li>F8 - MAIN SCREEN
<li>F9 - DEMON SCREEN (dungeon master screen)
</ul>
<p>To quit the game, press ESC and confirm using arrow keys and ENTER.
Note, this only quits your client process.
You can re-join the server (via "bin/snis_launcher" script option 4)
It still leaves several processes running, the snis_server, the lobby process
and snis_multiverse.  To kill all of them, run the "./killem" script.
<h3><a name="navcontrols">NAVIGATION SCREEN</a></h3>
<p>From the navigation screen, you can steer the ship and maneuver around.
Here is a 10 minute tutorial video about the Navigation screen.
<p><b>Note: Initially, your ship may have power to all systems turned off via Engineering.
Many things won't work without power, including steering and moving the ship.  See the

<li>The horizontal slider control below the warp drive controls how much power
the warp drive uses.  To use the warp drive, set the warp drive control slider
to the desired level, wait until the warp drive gauge reaches the desired
value, and press the <b>ENGAGE WARP</b> button.  Set the warp drive power to
zero when not in use to conserve power, although doing so will make warping your
way out of trouble take longer, so bear that in mind.
<li>The <b>GREEN ARROW</b> on the screen points in the direction of whatever
entity the <b>SCIENCE OFFICER</b> has selected for scanning.  A good way to
navigate is for the <b>SCIENCE OFFICER</b> to scan whatever you wish to navigate
towards (e.g. a distant planet) and then the <b>NAVIGATION OFFICER</b> can
follow the <b>GREEN ARROW</b>
<li>The <b>CYAN ARROW</b> indicates which direction the weapons are currently
pointed.  Note that the weapons are mounted on top of the ship, and cannot fire
on anything beneath the plane parallel to the floor of the ship.  Keep this in
mind while battling other ships.  You need to make sure your guns are able to
face the enemy, and you need to be aware that driving the ship in an erratic
manner makes it very difficult for the <b>WEAPONS OFFICER</b> to hit his
targets.  The <b>WEAPONS OFFICER</b> will remind you if you forget.
<li>To dock at a star base:
<ul>
<li>Have the <b>COMMS OFFICER</b> hail the station and request permission to
dock.  To receive permission to dock, you must be reasonably close to the
station, and your shields must be lowered.
</li>Press the <b>DOCKING MAGNETS</b> button to engage the docking system.
(to disengage the docking system press it again.)
<li>Maneuver the ship towards one of the docking ports on the station.  When
close enough, your ship will latch on.
<li>To disconnect from the station, press the <b>DOCKING MAGNETS</b> button
again.
</ul>
<li>Use the <b>STANDARD ORBIT</b> button when near a planet to enter
"standard orbit".
<li>The <b>COMPUTER</b> button allows you to ask the computer to do something.
You can control most aspects of the ship in this way.  For example, you can
type in "navigate to the nearest starbase", and it should point your ship
in the direction of the nearest starbase.
</ul>
<h3><a name="weapcontrols">WEAPONS SCREEN</a></h3>
<p>From the weapons screen, you can fire the laser turret and launch torpedoes.
Here is a short tutorial video about the Weapons screen.

<p align=center><img src="weapons.jpg", width=85%, alt="The weapons screen">
<h4>Weapons Screen Controls</h4>
<ul>
<li>The mouse controls where the guns are pointed.  The guns can yaw left
and right and pitch up and down, but cannot roll.
<li>When the mouse is at the
bottom center of the screen, the guns will be pointed straight ahead.
<li>Moving the mouse from the bottom to the top of the screen moves the guns
through the full range of pitch.
<li>Moving the mouse to the left side of the screen to the right side
of the screen moves the guns through the full range of yaw.
(Note:  Using the arrow keys, you can also yaw and pitch the guns.
With the arrow keys, the yaw range is not limited (guns can rotate
360 degrees.  This discrepancy could be considered a bug.)
<li>The <b>Left mouse button</b> and the <b>SPACE BAR</b>
fire the phasers.
<li>The <b>Right mouse button</b> and the <b>Z</b> key fire
torpedoes.
<li>The <b>mouse scroll wheel</b> or the <b>+</b> and <b>-</b> (plus and minus)
keys control the <b>WAVE LENGTH</b> of the phasers.  The <b>SCIENCE OFFICER</b>
can use the ships scanners to determine what is what the most
effective value for the wave length is for a given enemy.
<li>The <b>CHARGE</b> graph shows how much power will be released in
the next phaser shot.  It takes some time for the phasers to recharge.
Firing rapidly means each shot contains less energy and does less damage
(but if you miss, you will have wasted less energy.)  If the phasers are
damaged, or <b>ENGINEERING</b> has diverted power from the phasers, it
may take longer to recharge.
</ul>
<h3><a name="engcontrols">ENGINEERING SCREEN</a></h3>
<p>From the engineering screen, you can control how power and coolant is distributed
to the various systems of the ship. <a name="engdamcon">Here is a tutorial video about the Engineering
and Damage control screens.</a>
<p align=center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0IhoRilSmhg" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p align=center><img src="engineering.png", width=85%, alt="The engineering screen">
<h4>Engineering Screen Controls</h4>
<ul>
<li>Along the left side of the screen are the power and coolant
distribution controls for each of the systems on the ship,
<ul>
<li>SHIELDS
<li>PHASERS
<li>COMMS
<li>SENSORS
<li>IMPULSE DRIVE
<li>WARP DRIVE
<li>MANEUVERING
<li>TRACTOR BEAM
</ul>
<li>The slider controls labeled <b>PWR</b> control how much power is available
for a given system.  This is not quite the same as how much power the
system actually uses.  Most systems will automatically use as much
power as you give them.  Some systems (e.g. <b>SHIELDS</b>
and <b>WARP DRIVE</b>
have additional controls controlling how much power they actually
use (e.g. the controls on the Navigation screen control how much
power the warp drive will use.)  You can think of these power controls
on the left side of the engineering screen as a power deprivation
system.  You're really placing limits on how much power the systems
have access to, not telling them how much power to use.
<li>Note that as you deprive power from some systems, more total power
is available to distribute among the other systems, so you may have to
adjust other systems power and coolant levels to keep things from
overheating.
<li>The slider controls labelled <b>COOLANT</b> control how much coolant
each system gets.  If a system is using too much power relative to how
much coolant it gets, it will overheat and start damaging itself.
<li>The charts on the right side of the screen show the <b>STATUS</b>
and <b>TEMPERATURE</b> of each system.  If a system is too hot, the
<b>TEMPERATURE</b> graph will flash red, and this means the system
is damaging itself.
<li>The <b>STATUS</b> bar shows the general health of each system.
Hovering over the <b>STATUS</b> bar with the mouse will show a
popup window that gives the status of each of the components of that
system broken out.  The components may be repaired on the <b>DAMAGE
CONTROL</b> screen.

<li>There are two buttons on the screen labeled <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>.
These are <b>presets</b> for setting many power and coolant controls
at once.  The <b>1</b> preset button sets the controls with most systems
powered up, but with the warp drive powered down and the tractor
beam powered down.  This setting is useful for just driving around.
The <b>2</b> preset button turns all systems off.
<li>The <b>DAMAGE CONTROL</b> button switches to the DAMAGE CONTROL
screen.
<li>The <b>SHEILDS</b> slider control in the upper right part of
the screen controls the amount of energy the shields use.  The higher
the value, the more effective the shields will be.  Set to maximum,
the shields will use all the power available to them (which might be
zero, if the <b>SHIELD PWR</b> control is depriving the shields of
power.)
</ul>
<h3><a name="damcontrols">DAMAGE CONTROL SCREEN<a></h3>
<p>From the damage control screen, you can repair the various systems of the ship.
Take a look at the tutorial <a href="#engdamcon">video for the Engineering and Damage control screens
above.</a>
<p align=center><img src="damage-control.png", width=85%, alt="The damage control screen">
<h4>Damage Control Controls</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use the <b>Arrow Keys</b> or <b>W, A, S, D</b> keys to control
the movement of the robot.
<li>Use the <b>Space Bar</b> to control the robot's gripper.
<li>The screen shows each of the systems on the ship, with
each system having three components.  The components may become
damaged, making the systems less effective.
<li>To repair a component, maneuver the robot near the component
and use the gripper to pick up the component.  If the component
is not too badly damaged, the robot will repair it right there.
After the component is repaired, operate the gripper to put
the component back.
<li>Note, you must put components back in the correct slots for them
to work correctly, otherwise the systems will not operate well.
<li>If a component is too badly damaged, you will need to take
the component to the repair station located at the bottom.
Put the component into one of the slots on the repair station and
wait a moment for it to repair.  You can pick it up before it is
fully repaired and repair it to completion on the way back to
replace the component in its slot in the appropriate system.
<li>If you do not have enough players, or if you simply do not
want to manually repair the ship, you can press the <b>AUTO</b>
button, and the robot will autonomously repair the ship by
itself.  It probably won't do it as quickly as you could do
it manually though.
</ul>
<h3><a name="scicontrols">SCIENCE SCREEN</a></h3>
<p>From the science screen, you can scan ships, planets, asteroids, launch the mining
robot and help navigate to distant targets.
<p align=center><img src="science1.png", width=85%, alt="The science screen">
<p align=center>Short Range Scanner
<h4>Science Short Range Scanner Controls</h4>
<ul>
<li>The <b>Mouse Scroll Wheel</b> or the <b>RANGE</b> slider
control at the top of the screen controls the range (distance)
of the short range scanner.
<li>The <b>Left and Right Arrow</b> keys
keys control the direction the scanning beam is pointed.  The boundaries
of the scanning beam is indicated by two flickering lines on the display.
<li>The <b>Up and Down Arrow</b> keys
control the scanning beam width.  The wider the beam is the more volume it
covers, but the less resolution it has.  The narrower the beam is, the
less volume it covers, but the more resolving power it has.
<li>Items in the scanner are displayed at a distance from the center
which corresponds to the 3D distance.
<li>When the scanner has resolved an entity, you can click on it with
the mouse, and it, and nearby resolved entities will "pop up" out of
the display to give you an idea of how they are situated in 3D space.

<h4>Science Details Screen</h4>
<ul>
<li>Once an entity is resolved by the scanner and selected, you
can press the <b>DETAILS</b> button to see more details about the
selected item.  What you see depends on the type of the item.
<li>The <b>Warp Factor</b> value gives you an idea of what value
to use if you wish to travel to the entity via the warp drive
(that is, you may want to relay this information to
the <b>NAVIGATION OFFICER</b>.)
<li>If the entity is a ship, the <b>SHIELD PROFILE</b> may
indicate that some phaser frequency might be especially effective
(so you may want to relay this information to the<b>WEAPONS OFFICER</b>.)
</ul>

<p align=center>Long Range Scanner
<h4>Science Long Range Scanner Controls</h4>
<p>The long range scanner is useful for locating distant planets and starbases.
It shows a 3D view of the space around your ship.
<ul>
<li>The <b>Mouse Scroll Wheel</b> or the <b>RANGE</b> slider
control at the top of the screen controls the range (distance)
of the long range scanner.
<li>The <b>Left and Right Arrow</b> keys or the <b>A</b> and <b>D</b>
keys control the direction the scanning beam is pointed.  The boundaries
of the scanning beam is indicated by two orange dotted lines on the display
forming a kind of "orange slice".
<li>The <b>Up and Down Arrow</b> keys or the <b>W</b> and <b>S</b> keys
control the scanning beam width.  The wider the beam is the more volume it
covers, but the less resolution it has.  The narrower the beam is, the
less volume it covers, but the more resolving power it has.
<li>The <b>comma</b>, and <b>forward slash</b> keys rotate (yaw) the scanned
volume sphere to the left or right, respectively.
<li>The <b>period</b> and <b>L</b> keys rotate (pitch) the scanned volume sphere
down and up, respectively.
<li>The <b>K</b> and <b>semicolon</b> keys rotate (roll) the scanned
volume sphere counter-clockwise and and clockwise, respectively.
<li>The <b>ALIGN TO SHIP</b> button aligns the view with the ship so that
the view is as if from behind the ship with the ship facing forwards and
up is up, left is left, right is right, etc.
</ul>
<h3><a name="comcontrols">COMMUNICATIONS SCREEN</a></h3>
<p>From the communications screen, you can hail starbases and other player ships and
control what is displayed on the "main screen" as well as activate the RED ALERT alarm.
You also control the ship's inventory and can interact with the ship's computer to
ask it questions or even use it to control almost any aspect of the ship.
<p align=center><img src="communications.png", width=85%, alt="The communications screen">

<p>The row of buttons at the top is for the <b>COMMS OFFICER</b> to control
what is displayed on the <b>MAIN SCREEN</b>.  For this to work best, individual
player stations should not have the <b>MAIN SCREEN ROLE</b> checked (on the
<b>NETWORK SETUP SCREEN</b> when they joined the game) but only the computer
attached to the projector or big TV should have the <b>MAIN SCREEN</b> role
checked.  Essentially these buttons make all terminals that have the MAIN
SCREEN role switch to displaying the selected station instead.  The idea
behind this comes from Captain Picard's command, "On screen!"  The captain can command any
station's screen be displayed "On Screen!" and the <b>COMMS OFFICER</b> can
"make it so".  Note: it is also possible for any player to press <b>Ctrl-O</b>
on their station to make their screen be displayed on the main screen.
If they press <b>Ctrl-O</b> a second time, the main screen reverts to showing
the main view out the window into space.  So if the captain orders "Weapons,
On Screen!", either the <b>Weapons Officer</b> can press <b>Ctrl-O</b>,
or the <b>Comms Officer</b> can press the <b>WEAPONS</b> button on
the <b>COMMS</b> screen.  Again, if players have the "MAIN SCREEN" role
checked when they join the game, it can be a bit confusing, because
then <em>their own computer</em> will be considered to be a "main
screen".  In general, there normally should only be <em>one computer
per bridge</em> that joins the game with the MAIN SCREEN role enabled,
and that computer should be the one connected to a projector.

<p>The "EMF" chart in the upper right shows a measuring of local EMF.  When
an NPC ship scans the players ship, this chart will show elevated levels of
EMF.  This can give a heads up that some ship is scanning you, and an attack
might be coming soon.

<p>The <b>MAIN SCREEN</b> button in the lower right portion of the screen
makes the last 4 lines received appear on the main screen so everyone
can see them.

<p>The <b>RED ALERT</b> button toggles the red alert system on and off.

<p>The shields display is there so the COMMS officer can know if a request
to dock will be denied due to shields still being up.

<p>The zoom slider control at the bottom of the screen controls the zoom
level of the <b>MAIN SCREEN</b>

<p>So what can Comms do with this terminal interface? First of all, anything
which is typed in that is not a command is broadcast on the current channel,
which is by default channel 0, which all player ships receive. You can also
switch channels, and only player ships tuned to the particular channel will
receive those messages. The intent here is for player-to-player chat in a
multi-bridge setup. The channel system is also used (implicitly) for
communications with starbases and with mining bots.

<p>Commands you can type in are preceded with a slash, '/', along the lines of IRC commands.
<pre>
    /help -- displays a list of commands (I need to update the help screen)
    /computer <english request for computer>",
    /channel channel-number - change current channel",
    /eject cargo-bay-number - eject cargo",
    /hail ship-name - hail ship or starbase on current channel",
    /inventory - report inventory of ship's cargo hold",
    /passengers - report list of passengers
    /about - report information about the game (i.e. version number, etc.)
</pre>
<p>Of the above, /hail, and /computer are the most powerful.

<p>/hail is how you communicate with starbases to request permission to dock,
or other things that starbases do (not all of which are implemented yet):
<pre>
    LOCAL TRAVEL ADVISORY
    REQUEST PERMISSION TO DOCK
    BUY WARP-GATE TICKETS
    REQUEST REMOTE FUEL DELIVERY
    BUY FUEL
    REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE
        BUY SHIELD SYSTEM PARTS
        IMPULSE DRIVE PARTS
        BUY WARP DRIVE PARTS
        BUY MANEUVERING PARTS
        BUY PHASER BANKS PARTS
        BUY SENSORS PARTS
        BUY COMMUNICATIONS PARTS
        BUY TRACTOR BEAM PARTS
    ARRANGE TRANSPORT CONTRACTS
        BUY CARGO
        SELL CARGO
        BOARD PASSENGERS
        DISEMBARK PASSENGERS
        EJECT PASSENGERS
    SIGN OFF
</pre>
<p>You may /hail other player ships, or mining bots. The mining bots have some
functionality accessed via comms:
<pre>
    STATUS REPORT
    RETURN TO SHIP
    TRANSPORT ORES TO CARGO BAYS
    STOW MINING BOT
    RETARGET MINING BOT
    SIGN OFF
</pre>
<p>If you aren't sure of the name of the mining bot, you can ask the
<b>SCIENCE OFFICER</b> to scan it.
<p>The /computer command is the most powerful action the Comms officer can use,
with this, the entire ship may be controlled just by asking the computer to do
things in English. For example, stuff like this should all work:
<pre>
    /computer set a course for the nearest starbase
    /computer launch the mining bot
    /computer lower shields
    /computer set warp power to 100%
    /computer engage warp drive
    /computer turn left 10 degrees
    /computer engineering on screen
    /computer calculate a course to the nearest asteroid
    /computer describe <name of planet>
    /computer set warp drive coolant to 50 percent
</pre>
<h3><a name="maincontrols">MAIN SCREEN</a></h3>
<p align=center><img src="out-the-window.jpg", width=85%, alt="The main view">
<p>From the main screen, you can steer the ship with the <b>ARROW KEYS</b>
and with the <b>A, W, S, D</b> keys and additionally <b>Q</b> and <b>E</b>
allow you to roll the ship.  The primary purpose of the main
screen view it to be projected on a large screen for all players to view at once.
<p>The <b>backquote</b> key cycles through first person and a few third person views
of the ship.
<p>The <b>+</b> and <b>-</b> (plus and minus) keys and the <b>Mouse Scroll Wheel</b>
zoom and unzoom the camera.  Additionally the zoom can be controlled from the
<b>COMMS</b> screen.
<p><b>SHIFT-W</b> toggles the main screen view between front facing and weapons
facing.  This is fun to let the whole crew see what the <b>WEAPONS OFFICER</b>
is busy destroying.
<p>Note, in a proper multi-player setup, the <b>MAIN SCREEN ROLE</b> (on the
NETWORK SETUP SCREEN, see below) should not be active (checked) for most
players, but only for the computer which is connected to the projector or
big TV.
<p>The <b>R</b> key can be used to cycle through different renderer modes
(this is really just for debugging though.)
<h3><a name="demcontrols">DEMON SCREEN</a></h3>
From the demon screen, the game master can inject all kinds of objects into
the game, direct NPC ships, run Lua scripts and construct scenarios to entertain
the other players.  Note: The "demon" screen began life as a debugging screen,
and it contains kind of a mish-mash of features that don't necessarily hang
together in a very coherent way.  Consider yourself warned.  Some quirkiness
lies ahead.
<p align=center><img src="demon-screen.png", width=85%, alt="The demon screen">
<p align=center>Game Master Screen (aka "Demon" screen).
<ul>
<li>General Controls:
<ul>
<li><b>On the 2D screen</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Selecting objects</b> is done with the <b>RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON</b>.
To deselect an object, click it again with the <b>RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON</b>.
or use the <b>SELECT NONE</b> button on the left side of the screen.
You can also <b>drag with the right mouse button</b> to select a rectangular
area.  Objects in this rectangular area that were already selected will be
deselected, and those which were not previously selected will be selected.
<li><b>Moving objects</b> is done by <b>dragging with the middle mouse button</b>.
<li><b>Zooming</b> is done with the <b>Mouse Scroll Wheel</b>.
Where you zoom in is determined by the <b>mouse pointer location</b>.
<li>When one of the <b>object buttons</b> on the left side of the screen
is active (e.g. SHIP, PLANET, ASTEROID, STARBASE, NEBULA, MONSTER), then
the <b>RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON</b> places an object of that type instead of
selecting objects.
</ul>
<li><b>On the 3D screen</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Navigate</b> around by <b>right clicking</b> on objects.  You
will fly in near those objects.
<li><b>Turn left, right, or pitch up and down</b> by right clicking on empty space.
Clicking closer to the bottom edge of the screen pitches down, the top edge pitches
up, the left edge yaws left, the right edge yaws right.  The closer to the center of
the screen the slower the yaw or pitch, the closer to the edge of the screen the
faster the the yaw or pitch.
<li><b>Select</b> objects with the middle mouse button -- they will blink pink when selected.
<li><b>De-select</b> objects by clicking the middle mouse button on them again.  The will stop blinking pink.
<li><b>Move objects</b> by first selecting them, then flying to where you want them to be,
then click the <b>MOVE</b> button on the left side of the screen.
<li><b>Use the HOME button</b> on the left side of the screen if you get lost.
</ul>
</ul>
<li>The <b>HOME</b> button returns the camera (2D or 3D) to a fixed
location (e.g. if you get lost zooming around).
<li>The <b>SHIP</b> button
<ul>
<li>On the 2D screen this is a toggle.  When it is active you can
then click with the right mouse button to place ships into the
universe.  The type of ship is random.  With the 2D view, you only
control 2 axes of the placement, the 3rd axis is selected randomly
but limited to a relatively thin slice.  Though the slice is relatively
thin, in absolute terms it is quite thick, so it is not really possible
to place things precisely.
<li>On the 3D view, when you click the ship button, a ship is emitted
immediately right where you are.  The type of ship is random.
</ul>
<li>The <b>STARBASE</b>, <b>PLANET</b>, <b>ASTEROID</b>, <b>NEBULA</b>, and <b>MONSTER</b>
buttons behave just like the <b>SHIP</b> button except they emit
objects of the appropriate type rather than ships.  NOTE: <b>MONSTER</b>
currently doesn't work.
<li>The <b>CAPTAIN</b> allows the game master to "captain" an NPC ship -- that is,
drive it around and shoot with it.  This is best done in the 3D view.
To "captain" an NPC ship, select it in the 3D view with the middle mouse
button -- it should turn <b>MAGENTA</b> and start blinking.  Then press the
<b>CAPTAIN</b> button.  You can now steer the ship with the <b>arrow keys</b> and fire
the torpedoes with the <b>TORPEDO</b> button.  To stop captaining an NPC ship,
deselect it with the middle mouse button.
<li>The <b>DELETE</b> deletes the selected objects.
<li>The <b>SELECT NONE</b> button de-selects any objects which are currently selected.
<li>The <b>TORPEDO</b> only works when <b>CAPTAINING</b> an NPC ship.  It fires a torpedo
from the NPC ship.
<li>The <b>PHASER</b> button currently does nothing.
<li>The <b>2D/3D</b> button toggles between 2D and 3D view.
<li>The <b>MOVE</b> button (3D view only) moves the selected objects to your
current location.
<li>The <b>EXAG SCALE</b> checkbox makes objects appear bigger than they really
are so that you can see them from greater distances.
<li>The <b>NET STATS</b> checkbox shows some graphs about network statistics.
Currently there are graphs showing:
<ul>
<li>Total bytes/sec transmitted from the snis_server process to all clients
<li>Total bytes/sec transmitted from all clients to the snis_server process
<li>Round trip latency in milliseconds between this client and the snis_server
process.
</ul
<li>The <b>EXECUTE</b> button executes whatever command is typed into the text
box immediately above it.  Commands are as follows:
<ul>
<li><b>help</b> - displays a short summary of commands.
<li><b>mark</b> - (2D view only) On the 2D view, if you right click,
a flashing blue plus will appear in the display.  You can mark the location
with a name, by typing, for example: "<b>mark orion</b>".  Then later you can use
the word "orion" to refer to this location.  (This command isn't terribly
useful.)
<li><b>name</b> - give the currently selected group of objects a name.
For example, you might select a group of ships and type "<b>name myfleet</b>"
to give them collectively the name "myfleet".
<li><b>attack</b> - commands one group to attack another.  The groups
must be previously named with the "name" command.  For example, you might
type "<b>attack myfleet theirfleet</b>" to command your fleet ("myfleet") to attack
their fleet ("theirfleet").
<li><b>goto</b> - command a <b>name</b>d group to travel to a <b>mark</b>ed destination.
For example, you might type "<b>goto myfleet orion</b>".
<li><b>patrol</b> - not implemented
<li><b>halt</b> - not implemented
<li><b>identify</b> - identify a previously named group by deselecting all objects
and then selecting the named object.
<li><b>say</b> - cause the currently <b>captain</b>ed NPC ship to transmit
something on channel 0.
For example "<b>say make like a tree and get outta here</b>".
<li><b>clear all</b> - Deletes all objects except for player ships.
<li><b>aidebug</b> - Turns on some debug information about NPC ship AI state.
<li><b>safemode</b> - toggles "safemode".  In "safemode", if a player ship
runs out of fuel, it will be magically refueled, and NPC ships won't attack
the player (if they are already attacking when safemode is entered, they won't
immediately stop though.)  There is no indicator whether safe mode is active.
The purpose of this is to make testing easier (i.e. testing things out
without danger of getting killed.)
<li><b>enscript</b> - saves the current state of objects to a Lua script
so that they may be restored.  Not everything is saved, but most things are.
This is useful if you want to use the demon screen to populate a universe
for a scenario and then store that setup in a Lua script.  For this to work
the snis_server process must have been started with the --enable-enscript
option.  The lua script is created on the server in share/snis/luascripts.
Example: <b>enscript myscript.lua</b>
<li><b>TTS</b> - Text to speech.  Select one or more player ships, then
use the tts command to cause the computer on those ships to speak something.
(This appears to be broken at the moment.)
<li><b>CONSOLE</b> - toggle the demon screen console on and off. The console
is a large terminal-like text box that you can interact with.
<li><b>VARS [regexp]</b> - list tweakable variables and their minimum, maximum,
and default values on the demon console.  There are a number of tweakable
variables that can affect gameplay. You may optionally also specify a regular
expression as an argument to the VARS command to restrict the output to only
those commands whose name or description matches the regular expression.
<li><b>SET <em>variable</em> = <em>value</em></b> - set a tweakable variable. The special
value <cmd>DEFAULT</cmd> sets the variable back to its default value. List the
tweakable variables using the <cmd>VARS</cmd> command.
<li><b>CLIENTS</b> - list the connected clients. The currently displayed
station for the client is listed, along with the client number, the client
ship, and the possible client roles (as a bitfield. See the <cmd>ROLE</cmd>
command, below.)
<li><b>ROLE <em>client-number</em> <em>role-modification</em></b> - Modify or list
the permissible roles for a specified client number.  The client numbers may
be obtained using the <cmd>CLIENTS</cmd> command (see above.)
<p>Possible roles are as follows:
<ul>
<li><cmd>MAIN VIEW</cmd>
<li><cmd>NAVIGATION</cmd>
<li><cmd>WEAPONS</cmd>
<li><cmd>ENGINEERING</cmd>
<li><cmd>DAMAGE CONTROL</cmd>
<li><cmd>COMMS</cmd>
<li><cmd>SCIENCE</cmd>
<li><cmd>DEMON</cmd>
<li><cmd>TTS</cmd> (text to speech)
<li><cmd>SOUND SERVER</cmd>
</ul>
The command takes several forms.  Here are some examples:
<table align=center width=80%>
<tr><td> <cmd>ROLE 10</cmd> </td><td>lists the roles for client number 10.</td></tr>
<tr><td><cmd>ROLE 7 MAIN</cmd></td><td>restrict client number 7 to role <cmd>MAIN SCREEN</cmd>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><cmd>ROLE 7 +ENG</cmd></td><td>add <cmd>ENGINEERING</cmd> role to client 7</td></tr>
<tr><td><cmd>ROLE 4 -WEAP</cmd></td><td>remove <cmd>WEAPONS</cmd> role from client 4.</td></tr>
<tr><td><cmd>ROLE 3 ALL</cmd></td><td>allow client 3 to use all roles.</td></tr>
</table>
NOTE: You only have to type the first three characters of the role names (e.g. <cmd>ENG</cmd>
is the same as <cmd>ENGINEERING</cmd>.)<br>
NOTE: it is not possible to remove the <cmd>DEMON</cmd> role from a client.
<li><b>LOCKROLES</b> - Lock all clients to their current roles. This is useful if
you want players to select their own roles initially, and then confine them to those
roles for the whole game or a period of time. If a client is on the MAINSCREEN, or
the DEMON screen, then this will have no effect on that client.  ENGINEERING and
DAMAGE CONTROL are considered a single screen for purposes of this command.
<li><b>UNLOCKROLES</b> - Allow all clients to freely switch between all roles.
This is the complement of the <b>LOCKROLES</b> command.
<li><b>ROTATEROLES</b> - Rotate roles on client stations. Used in conjuction with
<b>LOCKROLES</b>, this is a good way to keep people from hogging the weapons console.
<li><b>FIND</b> - find an object with the given name, e.g. "find enterprise"
will find any objects or player ships named "enterprise" and print out the
object IDs for any matching objects.
<li><b>DUMP</b> and <b>CDUMP</b> - print out the state of the specified object
ID. "Dump" prints out the state on the server, "Cdump" prints out the state on
the client. The server and the client don't necessarily have the same (or any)
information for all fields. This command is really a debugging aid for developers.
<li><b>AITRACE</b> - trace (continuously print) the AI state of the specified
object id. If no object id is specified, any current tracing activity is ceased.
<li><b>FOLLOW</b> - Causes the 3D demon screen camera to follow the specified
object ID. If no object ID is specified, any current following activity is
ceased. Note that the "HOME" button will not work if an object is currently
being followed.
<li><b>LUA</b> - run a lua script.  The lua scripts must reside on the
server in share/snis/luascripts.  Currently there are few scripts:
<ul>
<li>MAINMENU.LUA
<li>DEMOLISHER.LUA
<li>SAVING-PLANET-ERPH.LUA
<li>SILLY-SPACE-BATTLE.LUA
<li>SPACEPOX.LUA
<li>TRAINING-MISSION-1.LUA
<li>TRAINING-MISSION-2.LUA
</ul>
<p>Example: <b>saving-planet-erph</b>
<p>Note: Now if you enter a command that isn't a built-in, an
attempt is made to run it as a lua script.  This means that
instead of entering <cmd>lua saving-planet-erph.lua</cmd>,
you can just enter <cmd>saving-planet-erph</cmd>, which is
a little more convenient.

<h1><a name="multiplayerinstructions">Multiplayer Setup</a></h1>
<p align=center><img src="multiplayer-setup.png", alt="Typical multiplayer network setup">
<p align=center>What a typical multiplayer setup looks like, showing
which processes typically run on which physical machines.
<p><h2>Step 0. Obtain Necessary Hardware for Multiplayer Setup</h2>
<p>You will need the following hardware:
<ul>
<li>A big TV or projector for the "Main Screen" view that you can drive
directly from a computer (e.g. chromecast likely will not work well.)
<li>A stereo or sound system of some type (something better than laptop speakers).
<li>Several reasonably powerful computers running linux (at least 3, preferably
5 per bridge).
<li>A network router or switch which can support as many computers as you're
planning to use.
Note: a <b>wired</b> router or switch is <b>strongly preferred</b> both for
performance reasons and for ease of configuration.
<li>(Optional) decent microphone or headset if you want to use the speech
recognition capabilities (need to reject background noise).
</ul>
<h2>Step 0.5  Understanding the Software Components</h2>
<p>It helps to have a basic understanding of how the system works
in order to set it up and troubleshoot in case something doesn't work
like you expect.  The system is composed of the following linux processes:
<ul>
<li><b>ssgl_lobby</b> - This process is the lobby server and is how all the other
parts of the system find one another.  There should be <em>exactly one</em> ssgl_server
process running in your system, on <em>one computer only</em>.  You will need to
know the IP address of the system that the lobby process (ssgl_server) runs
on.  (Use the linux command <cmd>ip addr show</cmd>
or <cmd>ifconfig -a</cmd>). The ssgl_lobby process has no
graphics and no UI at all.
<li><b>snis_multiverse</b> - This keeps track of player ships and stores
ship names, ship state, and ship password hashes.  This is what allows ships
to travel between solarsystems (between snis_server instances).  There should
be <em>exactly one</em> snis_multiverse process in your system.  This process has
no graphics and no UI at all.
<li><b>snis_server</b> - This runs the simulation of a solar system, its associated
planets, starbases, nebula, NPC ships, etc.  You need at least one snis_server, but
may have more than one.  This process has no graphics and no UI at all.
<li><b>snis_client</b> - This process is the face of SNIS, and is what the
player interacts with.  It is responsible for drawing all graphics and making
all sounds.  You need one snis_client process running for each player's computer
plus one for the "Main Screen".
</ul>
Note that the above diagram shows that <b>snis_server</b>, <b>snis_multiverse</b>,
and <b>ssgl_lobby</b> are all running on the same computer that controls the
projector and stereo, and this computer also runs a <b>snis_client</b> process
to drive the projector and stereo.  This is not a requirement.  The <b>snis_server</b>,
<b>snis_multiverse</b>, and <b>ssgl_lobby</b> processes could also run on
any other computers reachable on the network. It's usually just easiest to use a big
powerful desktop system for the "main screen" <b>snis_client</b> and then also run the
server processes on that system as well, and means the other computers are simpler to
set up, in that they are all identical, and only run a single process, <b>snis_client</b>.
<h2>Step 1. Preliminary Hardware Setup</h2>
<p>The first thing that you need to do is get all the hardware into your game room,
arranged on furniture in such a way that everyone can see the big TV or projector,
connect it all up and make sure it is nominally working.  That means:
<ol>
<li>Figure out which computer will run <b>ssgl_server</b>, <b>snis_multiverse</b>, and
<b>snis_server</b>.  It is easiest if these will all run on the same computer, but
this is not a requirement.  For the purposes of these instructions we will assume this
is the case, and we will refer to this system as the <b>Main Computer</b>.  Usually
this will also be the same computer which is connected to the projector (or big TV)
and the stereo.  Again, this is not a requirement, but we will assume this is the case.
<li>Boot up all your computers and make sure every computer can "ping" the <b>Main Computer</b>.
If this doesn't work, the game won't work.  Note, many wireless routers
are configured to deliberately prevent local devices from talking to one another
for security reasons on the assumption that they normally are only using the router
to get to the internet, not to communicate amongst themselves.  For this reason,
and for performance reasons, a <b>wired network switch or router is strongly
preferred</b>.
<p><b>Note:</b>  By default, the game assumes that the internet-facing network will be
used. If you have a private network (the internet is inaccessible) or if your system is
on multiple networks
and you wish to use a network other than the default
internet-facing network, special action will be required. Note also
that it is not currently possible to play with a multi-network setup in which all the stations
are not on the same network.  That is, you cannot host the lobby server and snis_server
on a multi-networked system and expect clients to be able to connect via more than one
network.  Currently, the lobby server and snis_server only server a single network, but you
<em>can</em> choose which network.
<p>If you wish to run the game on a network other than the default internet-facing
network, do the following prior to running snis_launcher:
<pre>
	export SSGL_PRIMARY_IP_ADDR_PROBE=192.168.1.1
</pre>
Of course you should replace "192.168.1.1" with some address that is on your desired network. It is
not required that a host be present at the address you specify, this address is
merely used to probe the host's routing table to find out which interface to use.
<p>If on the lobby screen, you see blinking red snis_server instances with IP addresses of 0.0.0.0
this indicates that the snis_server instances were not able to determine a network interface
to use.  Typically this means SSGL_PRIMARY_IP_ADDR_PROBE is not set, but should be (because the
internet is inaccessible from your network), or is set to an invalid value, e.g. it is blank, or
has a value which is not an IP address.
</ol>
<h2>Step 2.  Software Setup</h2>
<ol>
<li>Install "Space Nerds In Space" on all computers.  <a href="#buildinstructions">(See
Build Instructions above)</a>. Note, you should install <b>the same
version</b> on all computers.  The protocol used by <b>snis_server</b> and <b>snis_client</b>
to communicate with one another frequently changes, and if there is a mismatch, they won't
be able to talk to each other (in fact, will refuse to talk to one another most likely.)
Generally this means you should use the latest version from git on all computers.
</ol>
<h3>Step 3.  Setting up the <b>Main Computer</b></h3>
<p>There is a script to help with setting up: <b>snis_launcher</b>.
<ol>
<li>Log into the <b>Main Computer</b> as a non-root user and run <b>snis_launcher</b>.  You should
see something like this (assuming your username is capnkirk):
<blockquote>
<pre>

<p>Suppose you have set up Space Nerds In Space previously but development has
moved on and now what's in github and on the assets server is newer than what you
have, or that you have several players together to play the game but they each
have a different version of Space Nerds In Space.  How do you sync up your game
with the latest stuff?

<p>Use the following procedure:

<pre>
	cd space-nerds-in-space;	# Or wherever you checked out the code
	git checkout master;		# Just in case you switched branches
	make mostly-clean;		# Let's start fresh
	git pull;			# Fetch the new code from github
	make;				# Build everything
	make update-assets;		# Fetch any new or updated art
</pre>

<hr>
<h1><a name="speech-recognition">Talking to "The Computer" (how to set up speech recognition)</a></h1>
<p>Anything you can type into "the computer" via the Navigation screen or the Comms screen,
you can also just speak, provided you set things up. There are two methods by which you can
do speech recognition: local, pocketsphinx-based speech recognition, and Android based speech
recognition using your phone or other Android device. Both methods are done outside of Space
Nerds In Space proper, and feed the text of the recognized speech into snis_client through a
fifo: <cmd>/tmp/snis-natural-language-fifo</cmd>.  For that matter, you can echo text directly
into this fifo if you want to, e.g.:
<pre>
	echo "turn right forty five degrees" &gt; /tmp/snis-natural-language-fifo</cmd>
</pre>
<ul>
<li><b>Pocketsphinx based speech-recognition</b>
<p>You must install some packages:
<pre>
<blockquote>
sudo apt-get install libttspico-utils; # for text to speech
sudo apt-get install espeak; # optional alternative to libttspico-utils
sudo apt-get install sox; # for "play" command, used by text to speech
sudo apt-get install alsa-utils; # optional alternative to sox, for "aplay" command
</blockquote>
</pre>
<p>And for the pocketsphinx based speech recognition:
<pre>
<blockquote>
sudo apt-get install pocketsphinx-utils;
sudo apt-get install pocketsphinx-lm-en-hub4;
sudo apt-get install pocketsphinx-lm-en-hub4;
sudo apt-get install libpocketsphinx1;
</blockquote>
</pre>

<p>Once these are installed, on a machine that is running <cmd>snis_client</cmd>, you
can then open up a terminal window and run (as a non-root user)<cmd>speech/queeg500</cmd>
This will start up pocketsphinx listening on the default microphone to recognize text
and feed it into <cmd>/tmp/snis-natural-language-fifo</cmd>. If you're wondering why it's
called <cmd>queeg500</cmd>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=queeg+500">
this is the reason</a>.

You must begin every spoken command with "Computer". For example, try saying:
"Computer, Ramming speed!"

<li><b>Android based speech recognition</b>
<p>There is an Android app called <a href="https://github.com/Athulus/SpaceNerdsCommunicator">Space Nerds Communicator</a> which is very simple and just allows your Android device to do speech recognition and forward
the resulting text to a specified IP address and port. By default the port is <cmd>8080</cmd>.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Athulus/SpaceNerdsCommunicator/releases">Download Space Nerds Communicatr</a>.
</ul>
To use it, find out the IP address your machine running <cmd>snis_client</cmd> (e.g. run
<cmd>ip addr show</cmd> or <cmd>ifconfig -a</cmd>), and open up a terminal window
on this machine.  Run the following command (as a non-root user):
<pre>
	netcat -lvk -p 8080 &gt; /tmp/snis-natural-language-fifo
</pre>
This starts up a <cmd>netcat</cmd> process listening for connections on port 8080
(or choose another port).  Netcat just copies whatever comes in to its stdout, which
in this case is redirected into <cmd>/tmp/snis-natural-language-fifo</cmd>.
<p>Then run the <cmd>Space Nerds Communicator</cmd> app on your Android device, and
configure the IP address and port to match your snis_client machine. Then tap the
microphone button and speak your commands. The app will send them to netcat, which
will then feed them into the fifo.
<p>Note that with the Android app, you should <em>not</em> precede your commands with
"Computer". For example, use "Ramming speed!" not "Computer, ramming speed!"

</pre>
In this case, we see we have two devices of interest, <hili>usb-Thrustmaster_T.16000M-joystick</hili>
and <hili>usb-Thrustmaster_TWCS_Throttle-joystick</hili>.
<br>
<li><b>Step 2</b>: Figure out what the buttons and axes for your devices are. There is a test
program included with Space Nerds In Space called "joystick_test". Run this program, and you should
see something like:
<pre>
	capnkirk@enterpise $ ./joystick_test
	usb-Thrustmaster_T.16000M-joystick
	usb-Thrustmaster_TWCS_Throttle-joystick
	Discovered 2 joysticks
	  <hili>0: usb-Thrustmaster_T.16000M-joystick</hili>
	  <hili>1: usb-Thrustmaster_TWCS_Throttle-joystick</hili>
	Device: 0, time 99672500, value        0, type: 129, axis/button: 0
	Device: 1, time 99672520, value   -32767, type: 130, axis/button: 6
	Device: 0, time 99672520, value        0, type: 130, axis/button: 5
	[... many lines omitted ...]
	Device: 1, time 99672520, value   -32767, type: 130, axis/button: 7
	Device: 1, time 99672524, value        0, type: 130, axis/button: 8
	Device: 1, time 99672524, value        0, type: 130, axis/button: 9
</pre>
Here we see two devices, Device 0, and Device 1, corresponding to the usb-Thrustmaster_T.16000M-joystick
and the usb-Thrustmaster_TWCS_Throttle-joystick. We can press the buttons on the devices and move the
axes and this will cause more output to be printed. For example, moving the throttle controller:
<pre>
	Device: 1, time 99830028, value   -29041, type:   2, axis/button: 2
	Device: 1, time 99830168, value   -28732, type:   2, axis/button: 2
	Device: 1, time 99830196, value   -21727, type:   2, axis/button: 2
	Device: 1, time 99830224, value   -18962, type:   2, axis/button: 2
	<hili>Device: 1</hili>, time 99830308, value   -18918, type:   <hili>2</hili>, axis/button: <hili>2</hili>
</pre>
Here we see that the throttle axis is on device 1 (usb-Thrustmaster_TWCS_Throttle-joystick.) and
on axis 2. Make a note of this.  Pressing one of the buttons on the joystick, we see:
<pre>
	<hili>Device: 0</hili>, time 99919292, value        1, type:   1, axis/<hili>button: 0</hili>
	<hili>Device: 0</hili>, time 99919388, value        0, type:   1, axis/<hili>button: 0</hili>
</pre>
Here we see that this button is button 0 on the usb-Thrustmaster_T.16000M-joystick.
Make a note of this. Continue to do this with each axis and button you are
interested in, making a note of the button numbers and axis numbers.
<br>
<li><b>Step 3</b>: Modify share/snis/joystick_config.txt to add or modify the
configuration for your devices. First check to see if there is already a
configuration for your device.  Look for a line in the file that begins:
<pre>
	device:your-device-name
</pre>
If there is such a line, there is already a configuration for your device
and you just need to modify it to suit your taste. If there is no such
line, you need to add a new device configuration. Go to the bottom of the
file and add
<pre>
	device:your-device-name
</pre>
where "your-device-name" is the name of your device. Note, this is actually
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expression</a>
so if your device name contains a serial number it is possible to write a generic
name that will ignore the serial number part, but for most devices, just using
the device name as is will be fine.
<p>Follow the other examples to add mappings from your device buttons and
axes to game functions for each appropriate game mode. The game functions are:
<ul>
<li>damcon-gripper
<li>damcon-pitch
<li>damcon-roll
<li>nav-attitude-indicator-abs-rel
<li>nav-change-pov
<li>nav-docking-magnets
<li>nav-engage-warp
<li>nav-nudge-warp-down
<li>nav-nudge-warp-up
<li>nav-nudge-zoom-down
<li>nav-nudge-zoom-up
<li>nav-reverse
<li>nav-standard-orbit
<li>nav-starmap
<li>phaser
<li>pitch
<li>roll
<li>throttle
<li>torpedo
<li>weapons-pitch
<li>weapons-yaw
<li>yaw
</ul>
The game modes are:
<ul>
<li>mode 0 - main screen
<li>mode 1 - navigation
<li>mode 2 - weapons
<li>mode 3 - engineering
<li>mode 4 - science
<li>mode 5 - comms
<li>mode 6 - demon screen
<li>mode 7 - damage control
</ul>
So for example, if you have a "super-duper-brand-controller", and you want
the Navigation screen to map axis 5 to yaw, axis 6 to pitch, and button 3
engage warp, you would write:
<pre>
device:super-duper-brand-controller
 mode 1 axis 5 yaw
 mode 1 axis 6 pitch
 mode 1 button 3 nav-engage-warp
</pre>
</ul>

<li><b><a name="bridgeverification">I keep getting "BRIDGE VERIFICATION FAILED" -- what am I doing wrong?</a></b>
<p>This means one of several things:
<ol>
<li>If you have checked the "CREATE SHIP" checkbox:
Either:
<ul>
<li>You meant to create a new ship with the given name, but a ship with that
name has already been created.  In that case, choose a different name for your
ship.
<li>You meant to re-use an existing ship.  In that case, uncheck the "CREATE SHIP"
checkbox.  If the ship is already running in the game (other players are onboard)
check the JOIN SHIP checkbox.  If the ship is not yet in the game (but has been
used before and is recorded) then uncheck the JOIN SHIP checkbox.
</ul>
<li>If you have not checked the "CREATE SHIP" checkbox:
<ul>
<li>If you have checked the "JOIN SHIP" checkbox:  One of the following has occurred:
<ul>
<li>You have entered the name of an existing ship, and entered the password
correctly, but this ship is only known from past runs, the ship has not entered
the solar system where you are trying to join it.   In that case, uncheck the
JOIN SHIP checkbox.
<li>You have entered the name of a ship which does not exist, or mistyped the
name of the ship.  Enter the name of a ship which exists.
<li>You have entered the name of an existing ship, but entered an incorrect password.
</ul>
<li>If you have not checked the "JOIN SHIP" checkbox.  This means that one of
the following has occurred:
<ul>
<li>You intended to start up a previously used ship in a solarsystem
but that ship is already in the solarsystem with players on it.  You
need to check the "JOIN SHIP" checkbox.
<li>You have entered an incorrect ship name.
<li>You have entered an incorrect ship password.
</ul>
</ul>
<li><b>What is with this "JOIN SHIP" and "CREATE SHIP" checkbox crap?  Why is it so confusing?</b>
<p>"CREATE SHIP" has to do with whether snis_multiverse knows about your shipname/password.
The snis_multiverse process maintains a database of shipname/password hashes which is persistent
across invocations.  However snis_server also has a notion of whether a ship is known to it.
When you check "CREATE SHIP", you are telling snis_server to tell snis_multiverse to create
a new ship.  If snis_multiverse thinks the ship already exists, you will get BRIDGE VERIFICATION
FAILURE.  The "JOIN SHIP" checkbox means that you are attempting to join a ship that snis_server
already knows about -- that means, a ship that already has other snis_clients attached to it.
If you are the first snis_client in a session to use a ship, you should not check JOIN SHIP.
If you are <em>not</em> the first snis_client to use a ship name, then you should check
JOIN SHIP.
<p>Basically it is about intent.  The game needs to know the difference between intentionally
creating a new ship vs. mistyping a ship name, and the difference between creating a new ship
and joining an existing ship.  Not to suggest that there isn't room for improvement in how
it works.
<li><b>I made a ship, but I forgot the password, what can I do?</b>
<p>Or you made a ship, and you want to delete it. You cannot recover the
password, or recover the ship. You can delete the ship and make a new one
with the same name though.
First, make sure the game is not running. Use snis_launcher and select the
"Stop all SNIS processes" option on the system that is running <b>snis_multiverse</b>.
Then, on the system that runs <b>snis_multiverse</b>, look for a directory called
<b>snisdb</b>. Let's say you named your ship <b>enterprise</b>, and you want
to delete it and create a new one with the same name.

<li><b><a name="audioproblems">Sound isn't working!  (Or sound isn't working quite as I expected)</a></b>
<p>Audio on linux is complicated. In general, there are two main takes on how
audio should work in linux, "the pulse way", and "the JACK way". The "JACK way"
is generally concerned with professional audio recording, very low latency, etc.
The "pulse way" is less concerned with such things, and is more concerned with
"just make some damn sound work."  I'm going to assume you're using the "pulse
way," since if you're using JACK, you probably already know what you're doing
and can troubleshoot it yourself.

<p>Space Nerds in Space uses <a href="http://www.portaudio.com/">the Portaudio
library</a> for sound.  You need version <b>1.9</b> of portaudio (not 2.0).
There is a test program, <cmd>snis_test_audio</cmd> to help trace down audio problems.
It will print out a list of devices that Portaudio knows about.  Often,
when there is some audio problem, the problem turns out to be that sound
is by default playing on a different device than what you expected.
<p>Here is an example of running the <cmd>snis_test_audio</cmd>
program on my system:
<blockquote>

You can try alternate devices, for example, I can make it play through my
Scarlett 2i2 USB sound device by:

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>So, you can see what devices it thinks you have, and try them out.

<p>I also made it so snis_client can use alternate sound devices, e.g.
<blockquote>
<pre>
export SNIS_AUDIO_DEVICE=6
</pre>
</blockquote>
then launch the game and it will play sounds through my Scarlett 2i2 USB device instead of the default device.

<p>Another thing worth trying. On my system (Mint 18.1)
there is a "Sound Settings..." thing that I can play with. When the game is
running, it shows "ALSA plug-in [snis_client]: ALSA Playback on", and from this
GUI Sound Setting thing, I can dynamically switch it to play on either
"Built-in Audio Analog Stereo" (which I think is probably what portaudio calls
"0: HDA Intel PCH: ALC887-VD Analog (hw:0,0)", and the Scarlett 2i2. But I
think that is via pulse, so if snis_test_audio shows "pulse" as a device it
knows, then you should probably do: export SNIS_AUDIO_DEVICE={whatever number
portaudio thinks pulse is according to snis_test_audio output}  (You can install
<cmd>pulse</cmd> and <cmd>pavucontrol</cmd> if they aren't installed and
see if that helps.  The <cmd>pavucontrol</cmd> program should let you dynamically
control to which device a running program's sound output is directed.
<p>Note: I have seen the sound get stuck on a per-program basis to a particular
audio device. For example, I used the "Sound Settings..." to set the audio output
to HDMI for Space Nerds In Space. Later, I disconnected the HDMI cable. The sound
output remained stuck to HDMI, however, since there was no HDMI cable plugged in,
the HDMI interface doesn't even show up in the Sound Settings. However other programs
which used portaudio (e.g. Word War Vi) continued to work just fine. I was able to
fix this using pavucontrol (which is will show the HDMI sound interface even if no HDMI
cable is connected), or by manually using the SNIS_AUDIO_DEVICE environment
variable to override the default.

<li><b><a name="openglversion">OpenGL version problems</a></b>
<p>For most recent versions of Space Nerds In Space, OpenGL version 2.1 (aka "#version 120"
(See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language#Versions">OpenGL
version decoder ring</a>))
is required.  This is quite old, so your computer probably supports it.
<p>For awhile OpenGL version 3.0 (aka "#version 130") was required. This is
no longer the case.

<p>From Apr 12, 2018 until Feb 17, 2019, the shaders used by Space Nerds In Space required
OpenGL version 3.0 (aka "#version 130") or better.  If your computer does not support a
recent enough version of OpenGL, you can run the limited client instead,
which does not use OpenGL at all. Be sure to de-select MAIN SCREEN and
WEAPONS roles on the login screen, as these screens do not work well
with the limited client. The remaining should work sufficiently
well with the limited client, although <b>NAVIGATION</b> and especially
the <b>DEMON</b> screen will probably exhibit poor performance and reduced
FPS, so it's best to use the limited client only for <b>ENGINEERING</b>,
<b>DAMAGE CONTROL</b>, <b>COMMS</b>, and <b>SCIENCE</b>.
<p>NOTE: The limited client is not as well tested as the OpenGL client,
so you are more likely to encounter bugs.

This is because the program was built <em>optimized</em>
and stripped of debugging symbols (to make it smaller).  So now we should try
to recreate the problem with an unoptimized version of the program with
debugging symbols.  To make an unoptimized build, do the following:
<pre>
	$ <b><hili>make mostly-clean</hili></b>
	... lots of output omitted ...
	$ <b><hili>make O=0</hili></b>
	  COMPILE mathutils.c

	... lots of output omitted ...
	  LINK snis_server
	  LINK snis_client
	  LINK snis_limited_client

Now, try to recreate the problem by running the unoptimized game.
Presuming you're successful at recreating the problem, you should
have a new core file.

</pre>
Now it's showing us all the function calls along the way that lead up to the crash
within the <cmd>vec3_init</cmd> function, which is more great info to put into a
bug report.  This is probably sufficient.  But, if you want to go a little further...
<pre>
	(gdb) <b><hili>list</hili></b>
	414		quat_init_axis_v(q, &amp;v, angle);
	415	}
	416	
	417	void vec3_init(union vec3 *vo, float x, float y, float z)
	418	{
	419		vo-&gt;v.x = x;
	420		vo-&gt;v.y = y;
	421		vo-&gt;v.z = z;
	422	}
	423	
</pre>
Unless you know C, that probably doesn't mean much to you.  If you
do know C, you can see that "vo" is a pointer to a union, and the function
is setting several members of the union, and there aren't any other pointers
in the vicinity, so let's look at vo.
<pre>
	(gdb) <b><hili>print vo</hili></b>
	$1 = (union vec3 *) 0x7c
	(gdb) _
</pre>
Hmm, <cmd>0x7c</cmd> does not look especially like a valid memory address.
<pre>
	(gdb) <hili><b>print *vo</b></hili>
	Cannot access memory at address 0x7c
	(gdb) _
</pre>
Nope, it's not valid.  Digging a little more, let's go <cmd>up</cmd>
the stack and see what called this <cmd>vec3_init()</cmd> function.
<pre>
	(gdb) <b><hili>up</hili></b>
	#1  0x0000000000433034 in update_entity_pos (e=0x0, x=221934.969, y=-5072.68408, z=175696.594) at entity.c:189
	189		vec3_init(&amp;e-&gt;e_pos, x, y, z);
	(gdb) <b><hili>list</hili></b>
	184		}
	185	}
	186	
	187	void update_entity_pos(struct entity *e, float x, float y, float z)
	188	{
	189		vec3_init(&amp;e-&gt;e_pos, x, y, z);
	190	}
	191	
	192	void update_entity_orientation(struct entity *e, const union quat *orientation)
	193	{
	(gdb) <b><hili>print e</hili></b>
	$2 = (struct entity *) 0x0
</pre>
Hmm, <cmd>e</cmd> is null, but was passed in here, so let's go up the stack again.
<pre>
	(gdb) <b><hili>up</hili></b>
	#2  0x0000000000456383 in laserbeam_move (o=0x7da290 &lt;go+938448&gt; at snis_client.c:1335
	1335		update_entity_pos(o-&gt;entity, x, y, z);
	(gdb) <b><hili>list</hili></b>
	1330	
	1331		x = origin-&gt;x + 0.5 * target_vector.v.x;
	1332		y = origin-&gt;y + 0.5 * target_vector.v.y;
	1333		z = origin-&gt;z + 0.5 * target_vector.v.z;
	1334	
	1335		update_entity_pos(o-&gt;entity, x, y, z);
	1336		update_entity_orientation(o-&gt;entity, &amp;orientation);
	1337		update_entity_material(o-&gt;entity, o-&gt;tsd.laserbeam.material);
	1338		update_entity_non_uniform_scale(o-&gt;entity, length, 2.0 + snis_randn(7), 0.0);
	1339	
	(gdb) <b><hili>print o</hili></b>
	$3 = (struct snis_entity *) 0x7da290 &lt;go+938448&gt;
	(gdb) print o-&gt;entity
	$4 = (struct entity *) 0x0
	(gdb)
</pre>
So <cmd>o</cmd> seems to be a valid pointer, but <cmd>o-&gt;entity</cmd> is 0 (means NULL).
So it seems we have an unexpected null pointer.

to run SNIS on a private network without access to the internet (if you
cannot successfully ping 8.8.8.8), and you
are able to ping other machines on your network, then special action is
required to make SNIS work.
Let's say all the machines on your network have an IP address like
192.168.1.xxx.  When you start snis_launcher, you should do it like so:
<pre>
	export SSGL_PRIMARY_IP_ADDR_PROBE=192.168.1.1

<li><b>Latency and Bandwidth related problems</b>
<p>Space Nerds in Space is designed to be run on a LAN, not over the internet. Generally
on a LAN, you shouldn't have too much trouble, provided you have a <em>wired</em> network
and not a <em>wireless</em> network.
<p>You can monitor graphs of bandwidth usage and latency on the DEMON screen (press the NET STATS
button).
<p>That being said, there are several variables that are tweakable via the DEMON screen
which you can use to reduce the bandwidth requirements and potentially improve latency.
(note: use the "vars" command on the DEMON screen to see a list of tweakable variables and
their minimum, maximum, and default values).
<ol>
<li>BANDWIDTH_THROTTLE_DISTANCE: this is the distance below which updated values may not be
transmitted to player consoles. Far away objects do not need to have super accurate values
reflected in player consoles, so not updating them when they are far away saves bandwidth.
Reducing this distance to the minimum will save the most bandwidth at the cost that some
things may move around a bit weirdly, esp. at high zoom levels.
<li>DISTANT_UPDATE_PERIOD: For distant objects, updates are throttled and sent only so often.
This value controls how often. By default, it is every 2 seconds (20 ticks). Increasing this
value to the maximum will save more bandwidth by sending updates for distant objects even less
frequently.
<li>NPC_SHIP_COUNT: This is the number of NPC ships generated when the universe is generated.
By default it is 250. Reducing this drastically (e.g. say to 20) will drastically reduce bandwidth
requirements. This only has an effect when generating the universe, so after setting this, use
the REGENERATE command to regenerate a new universe.
<li>ASTEROID_COUNT: This is the number of asteroids generated when the universe is generated.
By default it is 200. Reducing this drastically (e.g. say to 20) will drastically reduce bandwidth
requirements. This only has an effect when generating the universe, so after setting this, use
the REGENERATE command to regenerate a new universe.
</ol>
Note, adjusting ASTEROID_COUNT and NPC_SHIP_COUNT generally will not help when running Lua scripted
scenarios as such scenarios typically do not use the procedural generation code used by the REGENERATE command
when populating the universe but instead typically use their own custom code or a pre-set
configuration when populating the initial conditions.
</ul>

<li><b><a name="internetplay">Playing over the internet</a></b>
<p>Space Nerds in Space was designed to be played on a LAN, not over the internet.
I do not recommend playing over the internet.  Be aware that the protocol is not
encrypted in any way and is not secure.
<p>Some people insist on attempting it anyway.
<p>You can control the port that the lobby server runs on via the environment
variable via the "Options" menu item of the snis_launcher script or via the
environment variable SSGL_PORT.  For snis_client, the lobby port number may be
entered via the "Options" menu of the snis_launcher script, via the SSGL_PORT
environment variable, or via the UI on the network setup screen.
<p>You can control the range of ports which snis_server will use via the "Options"
menu of the snis_launcher script or via the environment variable
SNIS_SERVER_PORT_RANGE, e.g. "export SNIS_SERVER_PORT_RANGE=32000:32100". You
might want to do this to limit what ports you need to open up on your firewall.

<li><p><b>Why aren't there binaries? Why do I have to compile it myself?</b>
<p>I will let Linus Torvalds explain why:
<p align=center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5PmHRSeA2c8?t=6m17s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<li><p><b>What about installing the game?</b> The above instructions for building the game have you
download the source, compile it, then run it right where you compiled it.  What if you want to install
it on your system?
<p>One reason you might <em>not</em> want to install the game is that the game changes quite frequently, and
if the protocol changes (as it does) the version you installed is likely to be out of date and you will
have to recompile anyway.  So "git pull" followed by "make" is not that hard.
<p>That being said, maybe you do insist on wanting to try installing the game in
the traditional sense.  I would advise against this (see below), but if you insist,
here's how to install the game into /usr/local:
<ul>
<li><cmd>make mostly-clean</cmd>
<li><cmd>make DESTDIR= PREFIX=/usr/local</cmd>
<li><cmd>make DESTDIR= PREFIX=/usr/local update-assets</cmd>
<li><cmd>sudo make DESTDIR= PREFIX=/usr/local install</cmd>
<li><cmd>sudo make DESTDIR= PREFIX=/usr/lcoal install-assets</cmd>
</ul>
<p>Note that <cmd>DESTDIR</cmd> is <cmd>.</cmd> by default, so you must specify <cmd>DESTDIR=</cmd>
if you want it to really land in <cmd>/usr/local</cmd>.

<p>Then you can run it via:
<p><cmd>/usr/local/bin/snis_launcher</p>
<p>Note that I don't use <cmd>make install</cmd> very much, so it's quite possible there are some bugs in the
Makefile around this area, though it worked as of Jan 16, 2019, so far as I know.
<p>If you do want to use <cmd>make install</cmd>, there's no reason to do so as root if you pick
a PREFIX that you have permission to write into.  The main rationale for installing things
as root is to put them into, e.g. /usr/local/ and the main rationale for doing <em>that</em>
is so that multiple users on the same system can run the program while installing it only
once.  These days, while linux is a multiuser system, the nature of this game requires that
each player have their own computer, and since the game uses OpenGL, you're not going to log
in remotely and try to run the game with X windows over the network, so there's no good
reason to <cmd>make install</cmd> as root.
<p>Also, <cmd>snis_launcher</cmd> will be installed in the bin subdirectory rather than
at the top level, so to run it, do: <cmd>cd $HOME/snis ; bin/snis_launcher</cmd>.
