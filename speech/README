I tried this again in Nov of 2022 with the pocketsphinx that you
can apt-get install for linux Mint 20.1, and for whatever reason it
did not work anywhere close to as well as what I was able to make
work back in 2016, as seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfcme7maygw

I don't know why it doesn't work so well anymore, but it definitely
does not work well AT ALL now, which is kind of shame.  Well, I suppose
with the neural net based speech recognition stuff that's around now,
pocketsphinx was far behind state of the art anyway.  Perhaps some new
speech recognition will come along and be not too hard to set up which
we can use as a replacement.

How to get speech recognition working with Space Nerds In Space
---------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install pocketsphinx on the client system to which the microphone you want
   to use is attached

NOTE: You can build pocketsphinx from source as described in steps 1.1
and 1.2.  Or you may be able to install it from your distro's package
repositories instead, which may be more convenient, but I don't have
instructions for how to do that.

1.1 Clone sphinxbase then build it.

git clone https://github.com/cmusphinx/sphinxbase.git
cd sphinxbase
sh ./autogen.sh
sh ./configure --enable-fixed
make
sudo make install

1.2 Clone pocketsphinx to the same parent dirctory as sphinxbase then build it.

git clone https://github.com/cmusphinx/pocketsphinx.git
cd pocketsphinx
sh ./autogen.sh
sh ./configure
make
sudo make install

NOTE: If you have not modified the vocabulary, you do not need to do steps 2
and 3 below, as they have already been done and the processed files are in
"snis.dic" and "snis.lm".  These instructions are mostly here so that
smcameron doesn't forget how to do it.  Skip to step 4 if you do not want
to modify the vocabulary.

2. Create specialized language files for pocketsphinx from snis_vocab.txt

Go to http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lmtool-new.html

Click the "BROWSE" button, and upload the snis_vocab.txt

Then click COMPILE KNOWLEDGE BASE

This will produce a number of files, including a gzipped tarball that contains
all the files.  Download the gzipped tarball which will be named something like
"TAR1234.tgz" (but probably different numbers than 1234).

3. Download and unpack the TAR1234.tgz, which should contain 5 other files:

1234.dic
1234.log_pronounce
1234.vocab
1234.lm
1234.sent

Copy these to this directory.

4. Run "queeg500"

$ queeg500

By default, queeg500 will use snis.lm and snis.dic, but if you have made
your own files (steps 2 and 3 above), you can tell it to use those files
instead, e.g. "queeg500 1234" will make it use 1234.dic and 1234.lm.
