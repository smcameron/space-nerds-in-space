on freegamedev.net</a>. Once around 2010 or so, I lost a similar thread over there for my
other little game, Word War vi when the forum database was lost, so I created this as a backup
in case something similar happens again.

<p>That looks awesome, but if you look at the interface they use on the old
Soyuz capsules to dock with ISS, yours is way more complicated. I'd be afraid
to slam into something if I were looking at all those shiny glowy lines. No
idea what they mean.

<p>It's a lot more clear what's going on when it's in motion. That being said,
you're not meant to drive the ship using this screen only. The main view is
useful for avoiding nearby things. This is more for navigating among things at
a medium distance. There are also 4 different camera positions ranging from
very far behind your ship to almost right on top of it. Switching between these
views (which it smoothly interpolates between) depending on circumstance can
make things clearer as well.

<p><b>fluffrabbit 22 Aug 2019, 23:53</b>
<p>It's good that you have different views. I'm so accustomed to single-screen
games that I forget all the components involved with this. The source looks
easy to build, but there seem to be several services you need going at once to
play it.

<p>There are several services needed besides snis_client (snis_server,
ssgl_server, snis_multiverse). You can run all 4 on the same machine. There's a
script to help start them all, snis_launcher:

<pre>
scameron@sirius ~/github/space-nerds-in-space $ ./snis_launcher

     Welcome to Space Nerds In Space

------------------------------------------------------------
No SNIS processes are currently running.
------------------------------------------------------------

   1. Launch SNIS lobby server
   The lobby server allows clients to find servers
   There should be one lobby server total.
   2. Launch SNIS multiverse server
   The multiverse server stores player ship data
   There should be one multiverse server total
   3. Launch SNIS server
   There should be one snis server per solarsystem.
   There should be at least one instance of snis_server.
   4. Launch SNIS client process
   There should be one snis client process per player
   plus one more per ship for the main screen.
   ...
</pre>

<p>The first four menu items of snis_launcher start the necessary services.

<p>Or, there's a "./quickstart" script that will just start everything. If
you're just running the thing by yourself, that's probably easiest, but for a
real session, snis_launcher is generally better, because most people will only
be running snis_client and nothing else on their machines.
<hr>
 <p><b>fluffrabbit 23 Aug 2019, 03:00</b>
<p>./quickstart it is. I'll have to try it some time soon.

<p>&lt;suggestions&gt;

<p>1. Put the build instructions in the source tree and link to that from the readme. (What if GitHub goes down? What if someone is building offline?)

<p>2. Get all the C&amp;H files out of the root directory so we can quickly see what is relevant to launching the game. I know there are some other organizational issues, but this would be a big help to the signal-to-noise ratio.

<p>3. For your apt-get install commands, you should stack all the essential packages into a single line like so:

<pre>
    sudo apt-get install build-essential portaudio19-dev libvorbis-dev libgtk2.0-dev libgtkglext1-dev liblua5.2-dev libglew1.5-dev libssl-dev libttspico-utils sox
</pre>



<p>I know there are multiple options regarding TTS, but I'll leave that to your discretion.

&lt;/suggestions&gt;

<p>There appear to be some depth sorting issues with the main menu. (Ignore the
disjointed lines; those are just a result of screen tearing.) This doesn't look
like the ship in the pictures, so spherical cows seem to have replaced
everything. It also won't run.

    1. Put the build instructions in the source tree and link to that from the readme. (What if GitHub goes down? What if someone is building offline?)

Ok.

    2. Get all the C&amp;H files out of the root directory so we can quickly see what is relevant to launching the game. I know there are some other organizational issues, but this would be a big help to the signal-to-noise ratio.

Flat no. Will fuck up the git history.
<blockquote>
    3. For your apt-get install commands, you should stack all the essential packages into a single line like so:


        sudo apt-get install build-essential portaudio19-dev libvorbis-dev libgtk2.0-dev libgtkglext1-dev liblua5.2-dev libglew1.5-dev libssl-dev libttspico-utils sox
</blockquote>

Eh, maybe.
<blockquote>

    I know there are multiple options regarding TTS, but I'll leave that to your discretion.

    &lt;/suggestions&gt;

    There appear to be some depth sorting issues with the main menu. (Ignore
the disjointed lines; those are just a result of screen tearing.) This doesn't
look like the ship in the pictures, so spherical cows seem to have replaced
everything. It also won't run.

</blockquote>

<p>Did you run "make update-assets" or "make models" ? You have to do at least one of those.

<p>You're missing asset files. I have seen openscad crap out on some systems
leaving some assets unbuilt if you went the "make models" route instead of
"make update-assets".

<p>After fixing the assets, try running with ./snis_launcher and choosing
option 1, then 2, then 3, then 4. Then there will be log files in
snis_client_log.txt snis_server_log.txt. It looks like snis_server isn't
started (might be due to lack of asset files, but very hard to tell what
problems you've got. FWIW, I compiled it and ran it on 5 or 6 different systems
a week ago with no problems ... did have some problems with OpenSuSE Leap 15.1
though, due to strange changes they made wrt pkg-config.)

<p>A fresh clone and build looks like this for me:

<p>Ok, I do see a problem if you do "make models" instead of "make update-assets" and run quickstart.
<pre>
snis_multiverse: SHUTTING DOWN SNIS SERVER for default
pid(985): readsocket other side closed conn
snis_multiverse: bad client, disconnecting socket 5
</pre>

<p>snis_multiverse decides to shutdown snis_server since it has no players... well, it shouldn't be but it is.

<p>Ah, I think I see why, it's a bit complicated. The quickstart unilaterally exempted the snis_server instance
for solarsystem "karado" from being shut down, but that is not always the correct one to pick for exemption.

<p>I think this should fix that particular problem: <a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/commit/b741e232b75017f7e3537ae4490a38d6b07e8514">https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/commit/b741e232b75017f7e3537ae4490a38d6b07e8514</a>. 

<p>Edit: With that, a fresh clone, make, make models, and ./quickstart works.

<p>You do have to check the "create ship" and "main view" checkboxes the first time though.

Just "make" and either "make models" or "make update-assets". I recommend "make
update-assets" rather than "make models" as it's more assets and it's quicker.
"make models" runs openscad to compile a bunch of scad files to stl files,
which takes forever, and can be problematic if you happen to have a broken
version of openscad. As an aside, "make clean" will wipe out a bunch of .stl
files, which will then need to be rebuilt either by "make update-assets" or
"make models". There is "make mostly-clean", which does everything "make clean"
does *except* make mostly-clean does not delete the .stl files.

<p>If that were true, the "--follow" option to "git log" would not exist,

GIT-LOG(1)                        Git Manual                        GIT-LOG(1)

NAME
       git-log - Show commit logs

SYNOPSIS
       git log [&lt;options&gt;] [&lt;revision range&gt;] [[--] &lt;path&gt;...]

DESCRIPTION
       Shows the commit logs.

       The command takes options applicable to the git rev-list command to
       control what is shown and how, and options applicable to the git diff-*
       commands to control how the changes each commit introduces are shown.

OPTIONS
       --follow
           Continue listing the history of a file beyond renames (works only
           for a single file).
</pre>

<p>Code breaking mini-game idea...

<p>Trying to think up some mission scripts, I had an idea for a coded message
containing clues which the crew has to decipher. The code would be a simple
substitution cipher, with each letter of the alphabet randomly switched with
another letter of the alphabet. Given a large enough ciphertext and knowing the
language of the plaintext (e.g. English), and knowing the frequency with which
letters occur in the target language (e.g. ETAONIRSH...), and knowing a few
common bigrams, (TH, HE, IN, ER,...) such ciphers are pretty easy to crack.
With some help from the computer (e.g. automated frequency analysis, and
allowing the user to try out substitutions easily), it might make a fun mini
game that the whole crew might participate in.

<p>What I'm imagining is two windows, on top, the ciphertext, and on bottom,
the plaintext (or, possibly alternating lines of ciphertext and plaintext
instead). Initially the plaintext window will just contain an underscore for
every character. Below the plaintext window is the alphabet, and the players
may type in possible substitutions for each letter, which instantly are
displayed in the plaintext window. Additionally, the most frequently occurring
2 or 3 unsubstituted characters in the ciphertext are identified.

<p>So it becomes a bit like a game of hangman, or "Wheel of Fortune", you make
some substitutions and see if you can recognize what might be some words. You
see a letter by itself, and you know it's probably the word "a". You see the
most common letter, and presume it is most likely to be "e", the next most
common is most likely "t", etc. A three letter word occurring many time is
likely to be "THE". As you make substitutions, more and more of the message
becomes apparent, and more and more obvious guesses for letter substitutions
become apparent, and eventually the message is revealed.

<p>Or, at least that's how I imagine it working.

<p>I could code the entire thing in Lua (though the UI would necessarily be
uglier and done entirely within the COMMS window) or I could do a little C
programming and make a special "code breaking" computer that would be nicer to
use, though it seems a bit too special purpose.

<p>What do you guys think? Is this idea worth exploring?

<p>Perhaps similar to this game:

<p>I like crypto quotes so I would enjoy an addition like this. I have a idea
for crypto quote game set in WW2 but haven't had the time to implement it. I
haven't tried this game so I don't know how well it fits into your overall
game.

<p>I have laid the foundation for the de-ciphering mini game, and here's a demo of
it. No mission scripts yet take advantage of this system though.

<p>Hunting NaNs

<p>What are NaNs? A better question might be what aren't NaNs. NaN stands for
"Not a Number", and NaNs are special floating point values that can occur when
you attempt to do things like divide by zero or other "impossible" mathematical
operations. Most typically in my experience, NaN generation due to dividing by
zero happens when you attempt to normalize a vector with zero magnitude. Once
NaNs are generated, they typically spread through any calculation in which they
are used, corrupting all sorts of calculations and causing weird behavior for
anything depending on those calculations (most typically, NPC ship movement.)

<p>Since Space Nerds in Space seems to work pretty well for the most part, I
sort of presumed that NaNs weren't really something I was bumping into much --
that my code was correct enough that I wasn't generally dividing by zero much
if at all. And I suppose that must have been mostly true -- mostly true in that
the game did work well enough, seemingly. But then I tried actually taking a
look to see whether any NaNs were scurrying around down in there.

<p>Oh my god... So many NaNs! So the way that you figure out whether you've got
NaNs is to enable floating point exceptions to terminate your program and
produce a core dump. The code to do so looks like this:

<pre>feenableexcept(FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_INVALID | FE_OVERFLOW);</pre>

<p>Then you compile everything without optimization and run it, and see what
blows up. Well things blew up *immediately*, leaving a core file for debugging.
For a day or so, this cycle continued: Compile, run, explode, debug, fix. Many
NaNs knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the core that day, I can
tell you!

<p>After awhile, I slew enough NaN generating bugs that things no longer
exploded immediately, but required several minutes of running before exploding.
Now, I think I only have one NaN bug left (that I know of). And I have a fix
for that one, I'm just not certain my fix is really right, so I want to think
about it some more before I commit it (or some better fix).

<p>In any case, if you're interested in the gory details, you can check out the
bug report on github: <a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/issues/236">https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/issues/236</a>
