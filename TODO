Too much to list, but here's a list anyway:

* Sound
    More and better sound effects
    Music (why? Player can run their own music separately.)

* Engineering screen
    make comms power do something
	This is somewhat hard, because currently comms works by a kind of publish
	subscribe method. You tune your radio to a channel number (subscribe) and
	transmit messages on a channel (publish). There is currently no notion of say
	"distance" that a message travels. "Private" messages between two parties are no
	such thing, a random channel is chosen (among a very large number of channels)
	so collisions are unlikely but possible. To implement impace of comms power and
	message travel distance, each message would need to be tagged with an origin,
	and then each message would need to be say, pre-distorted or suppressed based
	on (say) comms power of transmitter and on distance between message origin and
	message receiver. Which I guess is not that hard, but we could not use the
	generic send_packet_to_all_clients() for the broadcast channel as we do now,
	and send_packet_to_all_bridges_on_a_channel would need to be customized.
	Consider carefully how say, distorting messages, etc. might merely cause
	frustration without being fun, in the name of some quest for "making some kind
	of sense." Maybe binary works/doesn't work based on power and range alone might
	be preferable to message distortion?

	There is now an optional antenna system (turned off by default).
	For distant comms targets, comms only works if the antenna is pointed
	at the target.  You can aim the target at coordinates, and it will attempt
	to keep the antenna auto aimed at the target, however it can only aim the
	antenna in a hemisphere towards the front of the ship.  Any distant comms
	targets outside the hemisphere to the front of the ship cannot be communicated
	with.  It's not clear that this is any fun.


    Some sliders set only a maximum, while others control power usage
	this is confusing.  Figure something out to make it less confusing.
	(partially done -- fuzzing the power output kind of makes the
	situation more obvious.)

    Make the dials at the top of the screen (AMPS, VOLTS, TEMP) more relevant.

    Just for fun, Add some kind of "Reverse the polarity" button(s) (maybe on
    damage control) that does something useful under some circumstances.

* Communications screen
    Starbase comm stuff -- mostly done, there are undoubtedly more things that could
	be added. Probably need a way to shut off annoying messages about being attacked
	constantly for scenarios.

	Might be nice to have audio comms radio chatter when near a starbase.

    Enemy ship comm monitoring -- Right now there is no enemy comms to monitor. Seems
	like there should be something for comms to do here though. Do not have any very
	good ideas about how it should work though.
    Friendly ship stuff
    bridge-to-bridge comm
	I think this is done. If two bridges are on the same channel, then they
	can communicate.
    Take damage and power into account
	Right now, power of comms systems does nothing -- it works regardless
	This should probably have some ill effect.  One idea: based on power
	and damage, some fraction of characters is garbled. If high power and
	low damage, 99.9% of characters go through unmangled, as power drops and
	damage increases, a higher and higher fraction of characters is garbled.
	Not very realistic, but might provide a workable degradation.
	Other ideas?  Range limitations?
    Allow submitting natural language queries to 'the computer'
	This is mostly done with speech recognition, even. There are doubtless things
	the computer cannot understand, but it can already understand many things.
    intercept chatter between enemy ships
    ??? need to figure out what the hell the comms screen is good for.

* Navigation screen

* Weapons screen
     Improve joystick support.  Right now, weapons is probably unusable with a
	joystick controller.
     There are cases where damage from lasers is handled in the same way as
	damage from torpedoes. That is not how it should work.

* Science station
  * Allow scanning of planet surface
  * Currently the science beam scans in the XZ plane, rotating about the
    Y-axis, in world cooordinates.  The orientation of the ship has no
    effect on science.  This seems weird.  However, given the weirdness of
    the current SRS with the "3D projected onto 2D while preserving distance"
    thing that we've got, I'm not sure fixing this is a good idea.

* Add some kind of transporter control which interacts with science
  scanning of planet surface/scanning of ships to allow beaming up/down
  of "passengers" or cargo.

* Augment the tractor beam with a stasis field to hold ships steady
  and allow player to demand ships eject their cargo.

* Setup screen
  Try to make it more intuitive for people who are seeing it for
  the first time ever.

* write some kind of guide to hacking, to make it easier for others to
  contribute to this codebase.
  Signficantly done, though incomplete. See doc/hacking-space-nerds-in-space.html

* computer-controlled-ships
  loads of AI improvements and basic functionality
  remains to be done.
  Avoid going inside/through planets.  This is mostly done
  though I still see a ship crash into a planet every once it a blue moon
  * it should be the case that each ship model is associated with a particular
    faction.
  * It should be the case that each ship model is noticably different in capabilities
    and science should have some insight into this.  Some ships should be noticeably
    more difficult or easier to destroy.
  * Allow ship to ship docking?
  * There are still cases where ships get into strange "flipping" states, maybe while trying
    to traverse around planets. (This is mostly fixed, and was due to NaNs mostly).
  * There should be some kind of pirate ships, where the pirates contact the player via
    Comms and demand cargo be ejected, fight if not, etc. or maybe do this after damaging
    the player "enough". Maybe use specialized weapon to disable warp.  Details of how to make
    this work seem elusive, and how to make it so that all such encounters do not seem "samey"
    is unclear.  Maybe different ruses to lure in the player (e.g. various forms of distress
    calls) which brings us to...
  * There should be actual distress calls from NPC ships that the player can help
    out with, e.g. perhaps towing a ship to a starbase, picking up personnel in
    need of medical attention and taking them to a starbase, bringing fuel, etc.

* Add proximity mines
* Add missiles of some kind (Done.  Although they are kind of too powerful.)
* Add Lua controllable macguffins of some kind

* starbase behavior
  Allow suppressing default behavior of crying about getting attacked
  all the time and spamming the comms screen.
    DONE: Lua scripts can now do:
    set_variable("SUPPRESS_STARBASE_COMPLAINTS", 1);
    or it can be done via the DEMON screen.

* anomalies, macguffins etc. need to be implemented
* Possibly have some way of having special commodities.
  For example, Tradewars had corbomite, and if a ship took damage
  while carrying corbomite, there was a chance the corbomite could
  "go off", and hence there was the notion of a "corbomite trap", in
  which a honeypot ship loaded with corbomite was left around and
  anyone who attacked it got blown up. Some general way to add
  special behaviors like this to commodities seems like a good idea.
  Might be cool to allow a mining bot to carry a cargo container filled
  with explosives over to a ship and blow it up, or leave it near the
  ship, and and then the player can shoot it, setting it off. Another
  idea for a special commodity: remotely controllable black hole
  generator.

* 3D out the window view
  Fade distant objects to black
  Implement shadow mapping (very very hard.)
	  http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/intermediate-tutorials/tutorial-16-shadow-mapping/
	  https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/73851/how-do-i-fit-the-camera-frustum-inside-directional-light-space
	  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_mapping
  Implement PBR (very very hard).

* comms screen:

* Damage control screen:
  Make the various components of the systems less generic
  Make damage control a bit less useless
  Add "hull integrity" as a thing.  Right now, when shields get to zero,
    the ship explodes.  Really, hull damage and shield damage should be
    separate things, and hull damage should be the thing that blows the
    ship up, not shield damage.

* Need sound for wormhole travel
* I think the universe needs to be bigger, you can see too far out
  the main screen relative to the instruments, size of the universe.
  Or else maybe some kind of fog.
* joystick support for weapons and nav, and maybe others.
* trading of stuff mined from asteroids at stations.
* Need to be able to checkpoint-restart universe state on server side
  (how do lua scripts fit into checkpoint restart? Currently Lua ruins
  this.)
* more lua event callbacks, some mission scripts done with lua
  basically, flesh out the lua scripting system.
* Moar mission scripts!
* Remove use of "heading" field in snis_entity
  I think it is used by damcon, and by 2D demon screen though, so
  maybe not.
* make tractor beam work again/better.

LOBBY
* Allow multi-homed snis_server to work.  Currently only one ip addr is known
  to the lobby, so if machines are coming from multiple interfaces, it doesn't
  really work.
* Allow lobbyless operation, user configurable port for snis_server, and client
  able to connect to user configureable ip and port.

NICE TO HAVE:

* Make the universe more realistic in a variety of ways (but not too realistic,
  i.e. if the ship is the nominal size of The Enterprise, then Saturn would be
  bigger than the current known in-game universe -- obviously that is too much
  realism.   Also, have planets orbiting stars, stations orbiting planets, etc,
  instead of what we have now, which is just stuff randomly sprinkled around.

* (This might be a bad idea) Allow solarsystems to have real-time procedurally
  generated planet and skybox textures (this would be hard, and not as good as the
  offline generated textures). This would enable the autowrangling of snis_multiverse
  to produce the illusion of a really huge galaxy with hundreds or thousands of
  star systems.

* Make art assets live on server and be transmitted to clients on demand.
  (Sorta kinda done. make update-assets grabs assets from spacenerdsinspace.com
  but not on-demand.)

* Flesh out warp core ejection mechanic

* Make computer better at understanding waypoints.
  It now understands "set a course for waypoint X", but doesn't understand
  "set a course for the nearest waypoint", or "set a course for the selected
  waypoint", or "how far to waypoint blah"

* Make the central star shader better. Right now it is simply a
  dumb billboard, which looks ok, but there it looks unnatural as
  the star comes around the limb of a planet, etc. there's no sense
  of brightness. See for example: https://www.seedofandromeda.com/blogs/51-procedural-star-rendering
  The sunspots, corona, etc are overkill, but the lens flare, the way
  it comes around the edge of a planet, etc, all look really good.

* Make black hole shader better.  Right now it's just a billboard with a
  fuzzy black disc on it.

* Add a Real Time Strategy game into SNIS.
  Partially done.  But a long way to go before it's reasonable.
  (This was probably a bad idea.)

  This will give COMMS station some things to do. I envision it to work
  something like this.

  There will be two MAIN PLANETS, each belonging to two main OPPONENTS.

  To win the game, conquer opponents MAIN PLANET. MAIN PLANET has some
  hit points that cannot be replenished. Once depleted to zero, the game
  is over. So it is important to defend main planet.

  There will be some subsidiary planets and starbases between the two
  MAIN PLANETS. Starbases can build UNITS. Each starbase may be controlled
  by either opponent, or be neutral.  Players can request starbases that
  they control to build units, for some cost. The more starbases a player
  controls, the faster they accumulate money for building units.  To capture
  a starbase, a player must occupy it with four units. Once it is occuppied,
  it may be taken over by another player if that player occupies it with 4 units.
  There will be several types of units, tentatively:

  * Troop ship: These are the only units which may occupy a starbase.
    They are cheap, but weakly armored and slow, and can inflict minimal
    damage.
  * Gunship: heavily armored, slow, can inflict medium damage
  * Scout: light, fast, light damage.
  * Turret: Fixed position, heavy fire, good for defense.
  * Resupply ship: slow, light armor, can repair and replenish other ships
  * Others???

  Each unit can be given ORDERS (not all units can take all orders):

  (tentative):
  * Attack MAIN PLANET
  * Occupy nearest starbase (troopship only)
  * Patrol area
  * Escort
  * Attack nearest enemy
  * Move to destination

  So COMMS station will:

  1. Direct STARBASES to manufacture UNITS.
  2. Give ORDERS to UNITS.

  The rest of the crew of the ship can drive around and help
  the UNITS accomplish their goal by wreaking destruction upon
  enemy units.

  It may be that COMMS POWER restricts range of communication?

* Improve ship movement.  Currently ship movement can be a bit crappy.
  For example, sometimes ships will come to a complete stop on their
  way somewhere for a period of time for no real reason before continuing
  on their way.  Also, the way the orientation of ships is figured is based
  on which way they are moving, where it should probably be the reverse, which
  way they move should be determined by orientation, and to change direction,
  they should first change their orientation.  Also, they could fly a little
  more "cinematically", that is, like fighter planes, (maybe similar to Elite)
  with more pitching and rolling and less yawing. Particularly,
  ai_ship_travel_towards() and ai_ship_add_movement_variety() in snis_server.c
  could be improved (or replaced) with something better. Those alone do not
  touch the orientation problem though, so there's more to it than that.

* Finish/Improve Space Monster behavior.

  Currently, space monsters have a few behaviors. They have a notion of hunger,
  anger, and fear. If they are not hungry, angry, or fearful they will seek out
  another nearby spacemonster and kind of randomly move about if another space
  monster is close enough, or move towards the nearest space monster if the nearest
  space monster is too far away. So you tend to see spacemonsters in pairs or in
  groups of a few due to this. Spacemonsters will become angry at nearby ships and
  attack them. If spacemonsters are not very healthy they may become fearful and
  flee from ships (i.e. after taking some damage.) If a spacemonter becomes hungry
  it will seek out some asteroids to feed. It doesn't eat the asteroids, but it
  (presumably) eats something on the asteroids. That is about the current (circa
  March 2018) extent of the behavior. Maybe they should do something else (e.g.
  be influenced by the exterior lights or thruster activity of your spaceship...
  maybe you could avoid attacks by shutting down thrusters and lights?) Noises?
  Attempts to communicate? Other intersting behaviors?

  Currently when destroyed, space monsters simply explode, leaving no carcass.
  Leaving some carcass would probably be better.

* Improve black hole behavior.

  Gravitational attraction as currently implemented is kind of ... meh.  Not very
  black-hole-like. Rendering of black holes is currently crap.

* Add more special things, like comets, anomalies of some kind, just generally
  interesting stuff of one sort or another.  I.e., go all Dwarf Fortress on this
  thing and just program shitloads of custom variety.

* Make nebula more interesting.  Right now hiding in nebulas doesn't really work
  very well, because visually, you can kind of see right through them.
  I do not recall exactly what happens on science regarding things which are inside
  nebulas.  Also, nebulas are kind of small, and few and far between, so, the hiding
  place is rather obvious. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRgQX82O4&t=0m57s
  Maybe make nebula block science with ray-sphere intersection test.

  Look into raymarching signed distance fields (as if I know what that is)
  as a way of rendering nebula.  See: http://spaceengine.org/news/blog161008/
  See: http://iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions/distfunctions.htm
  for a load of signed-distance-field functions for various primitives.

* Get better models, or properly uv-map and texture models we do have. Scrap the
  more terrible models.

* Add support for DMX lighting. Started on this in snis_dmx.h and snis_dmx.c,
  however it is not tested with any hardware and probably doesn't work. And that
  is just a bare library to do something with DMX, the game doesn't even link
  those files in yet.

* Add support for more joysticks.

* Add support for toggle switches (as opposed to momentary switches).
  I.e. HOTAS warthog has some toggle (non-momentary) switches that are either on,
  off, or in one of several positions.

* Consider that some controls might well be served by both buttons and axes.
  For example, you might wish to assign an axis to control the warp level slider
  on the navigation screen, but mostly, people won't have enough axes on their
  joystick to devote one for that purpose, so may wish to have buttons to nudge
  the warp slider up and down.  That is, it should be possible to control sliders
  with both buttons AND axes at the same time. Currently this is not the case.

* Consider building some hardware controllers for each station and fleshing out
  the code for dealing with such hardware. I have started learning Kicad and thinking
  about building some arduino based stuff since arduino is easy. This looks like
  a good way to make the panels look good: https://imgur.com/a/DyQZL

* Consider allowing clients to fetch files from the server. That is, they could
  look locally for files, and if not found, download the from the server.  There
  are a number of problems to solve for this to work. 1) Typically the client wants
  to load a bunch of files before it even contacts the server. 2) If I try to do it
  with the existing opcode system, then it is asynchronous, and I have to have
  request identifiers so that I can connect up the response with the request in the
  client, and the client thread has to go to sleep and be woken up when the tranfser
  is done somehow. Not insurmountable, but seems like a lot of work, and doesn't help
  with problem 1. Maybe easier to just set up a known web server someplace hosting the
  data and set up a new connection per request.

  The idea would be, instead of open(), and fopen(), use open_and_fetch(), and
  fopen_and_fetch(), and these would attempt a local [f]open(), and if that doesn't
  work, fetch the file, then re-do the [f]open(). That way client installation should
  be simpler, and scenarios could get their files distributed on-demand.

* The client currently knows many demon screen commands and many of them are implemented
  with custom opcodes sent to the server. Recently, server-side builtin demon commands
  have been implemented, and many of these client-side commands and opcodes could be replaced
  by server-side builtins.  This should probably be done wherever possible. See "demon_cmd_def"
  variable in snis_client.c.

* Replace god-awful libpng entirely with gtk stuff.  Gtk knows how to read png files already.
  E.g. use gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file(). See https://developer.gnome.org/gdk-pixbuf/stable/gdk-pixbuf-The-GdkPixbuf-Structure.html
  and https://developer.gnome.org/gdk-pixbuf/unstable/gdk-pixbuf-File-Loading.html#gdk-pixbuf-new-from-file
  Actually, on looking into it, gtk uses libpng to read png files.  Jesus I am surprised nobody
  has re-written libpng from scratch just to fix the horrible API it has (setjmp/longjmp as an
  error handling API? Really?  On looking into it: https://libspng.org/ which is motivated to
  provide a better API, but it uses fucking cmake, though it's available as a single .h and .c
  file pair too. Also, lodepng is another alternate library.)

* Replace texture reloading system based on file timestamp polling
  in graph_dev_opengl.c (e.g.  graph_dev_reload_changed_textures() and
  graph_dev_reload_changed_cubemap_textures) with an inotify(7) based system.
  Actually, only mesh_viewer uses this texture reloading system, so it's not
  really a priority.

* (DONE) Allow snis_client to do the disk i/o part of reloading textures in another
  thread.  Right now, when we're traversing a warp gate, it's loading a bunch
  of per-solarsystem textures from the main thread, calling load_textures() from
  main_da_expose(), which it has to do that from the main thread.  But the disk
  i/o part could be done in another thread.  This would allow some transition
  thing, like some kind of warp gate effect to be animated.  Right now, it doesn't
  update the display at all once it calls load_textures() until load_textures()
  returns -- which can take several seconds.  (THIS IS COMPLETE).  Now there is a
  work queue system, and texture load requests go through the work queue system,
  which does file loading and PNG decoding via a worker thread pool which completes
  requests asynchronously, and entities which rely on textures not yet finished
  loading are not rendered until the asset load request is marked complete by a
  worker thread.

* This is an interesting article about using doubles rather than floats for translations
  to avoid jitteriness when far from the origin without having a floating origin (means,
  it might even work for multi-player.)
  https://godotengine.org/article/emulating-double-precision-gpu-render-large-worlds
  Has some limitations though, so not sure it will really work or gain that much for
  our purposes.
  This appears to be the commit that article is talking about:
  https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/27a3014f5052ae40f89684a5559c17fbebe7aa8d
  And here is a paper: https://andrewthall.org/papers/df64_qf128.pdf

* share/snis and snisdb should probably honor the XDG directory specification for runtime
  data.  For snisdb this should be pretty straightforward as we already have SNIS_DB_DIR
  to allow moving it.  But share/snis is a little trickier.  Currently some of that stuff
  is in github, and some on spacenerdsinspace.com.  The idea I have for now is to modify
  snis_update_assets to be able to copy data from a local source as well as from remote,
  and allow it to generate a manifest for local stuff on the fly by traversing the directory
  and knowing to skip .git dirs, etc.  Then, either via snis_launcher, or maybe via
  snis_client and snis_server (with some interlock to prevent them stomping on each other)
  the assets could be updated to copy them under (by default) ~/.local/share/space-nerds-in-space
  in accordance with XDG dir spec for runtime usage.  snis_update_assets could check for
  updates periodically (probably the first run, plus on startup if more than a week has
  elapsed, or on user demand.)  Something like that.
