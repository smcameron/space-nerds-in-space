# Joystick config file for Space Nerds In Space
# The code that reads this file is in joystick_config.c
#
# If you add any new joystick configs to this file, please
# consider forwarding the new config to stephenmcameron@gmail.com
#
# the "device:" lines are followed by a regular expression to match the
# name of the joystick device as it appears in /dev/input/by-id.
# (See the output of ls -l /dev/input/by-id).
# Note, I am using the old style devices that link to /dev/js*, not
# the new "evdev" devices. You can tell the old from the new as the
# new device names end in "-event-joystick", while the old names just
# end in "-joystick" (no "-event-").
#
# Following each "device:..." line, are the mappings from (mode, (button/axis)
# tuples to game functions for that device.
#
# The modes are as follows:
# (See DISPLAYMODE_* #defines in snis_packet.h)
#
# mode main - main screen
# mode navigation - navigation
# mode weapons - weapons
# mode engineering - engineering
# mode science - science
# mode comms - comms
# mode demon - demon screen
# mode damcon - damage control
#
# Instead of names, you may also use numbers
#
# mode 0 # means the same as mode main
# mode 1 # means the same as mode navigation
# mode 2 # means the same as mode weapons
# mode 3 # means the same as mode engineering
# mode 4 # means the same as mode science
# mode 5 # means the same as mode comms
# mode 6 # means the same as mode demon
# mode 7 # means the same as mode damcon
#
# You may also set the mode by itself and it
# remains set until it is changed again
#
# The game functions are as follows:
#
# yaw, roll, pitch,
# phaser, torpedo,  missile,  weapons-yaw,  weapons-pitch, damcon-pitch,
# damcon-roll, throttle, warp, weapons-wavelength, damcon-gripper, nav-engage-warp,
# nav-standard-orbit, nav-docking-magnets, nav-attitude-indicator-abs-rel,
# nav-starmap, nav-reverse, nav-lights, nav-nudge-warp-up, nav-nudge-warp-down,
# nav-nudge-zoom-up, nav-nudge-zoom-down, weapons-wavelength-up,
# weapons-wavelength-down, nav-change-pov
#
#
# Here are examples of mapping a mode + button or mode + axis to a function:
#
#  mode 0 button 1 phaser		# map mode 0 button 1 to phaser function
#  mode 1 axis 2 yaw			# map mode 1 axis 2 to yaw function
#  mode 1 invert axis 3 roll 		# map mode 1 axis 3 to roll function and invert the axis
#  mode 1 axis 2 throttle 0		# map mode 1 axis 2 to throttle with 0 deadzone
#					# (default deadzone is 6000).
#  mode navigation
#    axis 2 yaw
#    invert axis 1 pitch
#    axis 0 roll
