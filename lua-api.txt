NOTE: I am still working out what the lua api should look like, so
      all of this is subject to change.  But this is what it looks like
      now (barring bitrot of this document, which is not inconceivable.)

TIPS ON DEBUGGING YOUR LUA SCRIPTS:

	1. Run luac on your script -- if luac can't compile it, it won't run in SNIS either.
		This is a necessary but insufficient condition -- that is, just because luac is happy
		with your script doesn't mean it contains no errors.

	2. Add print statements into your lua functions to see what they're doing.
	   The output will be mixed in with the output of snis_server.

	3. Watch out for some common errors:

		A. Specifying the name of a function in a callback registration without quotes.

		function player_docked_callback(player_id, station_id)
			do_somthing();
		end

		register_callback("player-docked-event", player_docked_callback);   -- THIS IS WRONG!
		register_callback("player-docked-event", "player_docked_callback"); -- This is correct.

		B.  Misspelling an event name or function name:

		register_callback("player_docked_event", player_docked_callback);   -- THIS IS WRONG!
		register_callback("player-dock-event", "player_docked_callback");   -- THIS IS WRONG!
		register_callback("player-docked-event", "player_dock_callback");   -- THIS IS WRONG!
		register_callback("player-docked-event", "player_docked_callback"); -- This is correct.

		The symptom of this is typically it just doesn't seem to get called or doesn't do anything.
		Look in the output of snis_server for things like:

		snis_server: lua callback 'blahblah' had error 2: 'attempt to call a nil value'.
		do_lua_pcall
		Stack trace:
		- ./snis_server(stacktrace+0x3b) [0x41114d]
		- ./snis_server(main+0x2d41) [0x40b4a1]
		- /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xf5) [0x7fc02f899ec5]
		- ./snis_server() [0x40bc97]

		C. Misspelling a variable name or function name

		Like many interpreted languages, if you misspell a variable name, Lua happily makes
		a new variable with the new misspelled name.   Watch out for unexpectedly nil values
		or for misspelled function names, things like this in snis_server output:

		Error executing lua script: share/snis/luascripts/ERRORTEST.LUA:4: attempt to call global 'blahblah' (a nil value)

		or things like this:

		snis_server: lua callback 'mycallback' had error 2: 'share/snis/luascripts/ERRORTEST.LUA:5: attempt to call global 'blahblah' (a nil value)'.
		do_lua_pcall
		Stack trace:
		- ./snis_server(stacktrace+0x3b) [0x41114d]
		- ./snis_server(main+0x2d41) [0x40b4a1]
		- /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xf5) [0x7f3149f69ec5]
		- ./snis_server() [0x40bc97]

	3. Last resort, debug it in snis_server.c

		All the lua callable functions are set up in snis_server.c in a function
		called "setup_lua", and are named with a leading "l_".  You can put printf()
		statements inside these "l_..." functions to see what they're doing or if theyr'e
		getting called how you expect.  The output will be mixed in with snis_server output.

Space Nerds In Space lua inteface:

Locations in space nerds in space:
	x,y,z coords, (0,0,0) is the upper left of the known universe,
	Most of the action is more or less confined to the x-z plane.
	Positive x is to the right, negative x is to the left
	Positive z is out of the screen, negative z is into the screen,
	Positive y is up, negative y is down.

	Note: that to the player within the game, the z and y coords are swapped,
	so that *to the player*, positive y is out of the screen, negative y into the
	screen, and positive z is up, negative z is down.  (See user_coords() function
	below.)

	TBD function to return size of known universe?

Functions which you may call from lua: 

clear_all() -- this clears the entire universe except for human controlled ships
	all objects are deleted.  Probably you only use this at the beginning of
	a mission script.

id = add_random_ship() -- adds a random ship to the universe in a random location
	returns the "id" of the ship.  If adding ship failed, -1.0 is returned.

id = add_ship(name, x, y, z, type, faction, auto_respawn) -- adds a ship to the
        universe of the specified type and faction at the specified locations.  If
        adding ship failed, -1.0 is returned.

id = add_asteroid(x, y, z) -- adds an asteroid at the specified location
	(it will orbit around the center of the universe)

set_asteroid_speed(id, speed);
	Sets the speed of the asteroid with the specified id to the specified
	value.  The speed should be between 0 and 1.

set_asteroid_minerals(id, carbon, silicates, nickeliron, preciousmetals); -- sets the proportions
	of carbon, silicates, nickeliron, preciousmetals.  Returns 0.0 on success, nil otherwise.
	May fail if id doesn't match an asteroid.

	Example:

	asteroid = add_asteroid(1000.0, 1000.0, 10000.0);
	set_asteroid_speed(asteroid, 0.0);
	set_asteroid_minerals(asteroid, 90.0, 5.0, 3.0, 2.0);

id = add_cargo_container(x, y, z, vx, vy, vz) -- adds a cargo container at specified
	location and velocity

id = add_derelict(name, x, y, z, shiptype, faction) -- adds a derelict vessel at
	specified location

rc = derelict_set_ships_log(id, ships_log_entry)
	Sets the ships log entry (a string) to the specified value for the derelict identified
	by id. Returns 0.0 if successful, -1.0 otherwise. Maximum length of ships_log_entry is
	100 characters.

	Example:

	id = add_derelict("BOUNTY", 100, 100, 100, 1, 1);
	derelict_set_ships_log(id, "Stardate 112.34. Situation is dire. We are being attacked by Zarkon disruptors.");

	These log entries can be recovered by the mining bot.

id = add_starbase(x, y, z, n) - adds a starbase at location x,y with number n (0 <= n <= 99).
	the starbase will be named "SB-n"
	TODO: allow starbases to be named arbitrary strings.

id = add_planet(name, x, y, z, r, s) - adds planet at x,y,z with specified name, radius,
	and security (security: 0 = low, 1 = medium, 2 = high)
	returns id of planet or -1.0 on failure.   Radius should be between 800 and 7000.

id = add_black_hole(name, x, y, z, r) - adds a black hole at x,y,z with specified name, and
	radius, returns id of black hole or -1.0 on failure.   Radius should be between 1000
	and 7000.

id = add_nebula(name, x, y, z, r) - adds nebula at x,y with specified radius and name,
	returns id of nebula or -1.0 on failure. 

id = add_spacemonster(name, x, y, z) - adds spacemonster at x,y,z with specified name,
	returns id of spacemonster or -1.0 on failure.

id1, id2 = add_wormhole_pair(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2) - adds connected wormholes at the
	specified location, returns -1 for a wormhole id that fails to create.

x,y,z = get_object_location(object_id); -- x,y,z location coordinates of specified object.
	If the object_id does not exist (anymore), x,y,z will be nil.

(table of player ship ids) = get_player_ship_ids(); -- returns a table containing the
	ids of all the player ships, indexed 1..n.

	Example:

	player_ids = get_player_ship_ids();
	for i, v in pairs(player_ids) do
		print(i, v);
		x, y, z = get_object_location(v);
		if (x) then
			print("object ", v, " location is ", x, ", ", y, ", ", z);
		else
			print("object ", v, " no longer exists.");
		end
	end

move_object(object_id, x, y, z); -- move object to x, y, z location.

set_object_velocity(object_id, vx, vy, vz); set's and object's velocity

set_object_orientation(object_id, rotx, roty, rotz, angle);
	sets an object's orientation.  The object orientation is
	the rotation around the axis defined by the vector from the
	origin (0, 0, 0)  to (rotx, roty, rotz) of angle (in radians).

set_object_rotational_velocity(object_id, rotx, roty, rotz, angle);
	sets an objects rotational velocity about the axis defined by
	rotx, roty, rotz to angle (in radians) per tick (1 tick is 1/10th sec).
	NOTE: This really only works for "block" objects (useful) and for
	free-floating turrets (not useful).  Other object types either do not have
	rotational velocities, or the rotational velocities are computed entirely
	client side and are thus not mutable.

align_object_towards(object_id, x, y, z, max_rads)
	Aligns and object to face towards x, y, z (facing means the object's local x
	points at the destination.  max_rads is the maximum angle to adjust by.
	returns the total angle of rotation which needs to be applied. (numbers near
	zero mean alignment is achieved.  If the object_id isn't found
	-720.0 * PI / 180 is returned.

set_object_relative_position(object_id, rx, ry, rz);
	Sets and objects position relative to a parent object to which it is
	attached.  Note: This only works for "block" objects so far.

delete_object(object_id) -- delete the specified object from the universe

comms_transmission(object_id, transmission); -- causes the object to transmit the
	specified transmission via comms on channel 0.  Note: you may prefer to
	use comms_channel_transmit() instead.  See below.

comms_channel_listen(name, channel, callback)

	Note: if you transmit on a channel you are listening to, you will recieve your
	own transmissions, so you must be prepared to ignore them.

		function transmission_received(from, channel, message)
		   print("Transmission recieved from", from, " on channel ", channel, ".")
		   print("Message: ", message)
		end

		comms_channel_listen("Bob", "transmission_received", 10);

	Beware of something like the following:

		function transmission_received(from, channel, message)
		   print("Transmission recieved from", from, " on channel ", channel, ".")
		   print("Message: ", message)
		   comms_channel_transmit("Bob", channel, "Hello!"); -- THIS IS A PROBLEM
		end
		comms_channel_listen("Bob", "transmission_received", 10);

	When you receive on a channel, you will transmit on the same channel, and then
	you will receive your own transmission, to which you will respond, which you will
	then recieve, to which you will respond, etc.  You'll set up a loop.  So, if you
	need to transmit on the same channel you receive on (which is the normal case)
	you have to figure out a way to ignore your own transmissions.  The easiest way
	is to decouple the transmissions from the messages received.  That is, do not
	transmit in response to a message received, or if you must, only respond to very
	specific messages which you never transmit yourself.

comms_channel_unlisten(name, channel)

	Stop listening on the given channel (your listener callback won't be
	called anymore).

	Example:

	comms_channel_unlisten("Bob", 10);

comms_channel_transmit(name, channel, text)

	Transmit the given text from the given name on the given channel
	Similar to comms_transmission except can transmit on channels other than
	zero, and instead of using the name of the object specified, uses whatever
	name you give it.

	Example:

	comms_channel_transmit("Bob", 10, "Hi from Bob!");

text_to_speech(player_ship_id, text_to_speak); -- causes player ship to use text to speech to
	say the specified text.

register_callback(event, callback); -- event is a string, the name of the event you wish
	to register a callback for, and	callback is a string, the name of the lua function
	you want to get called when that event occurs.  The arguments passed to the lua
	function and return values from the lua function depend on the event (see events,
	above.)

get_object_name(object_id); -- returns string name of specified object

register_timer_callback(callback, timer_ticks, cookie)
	register a function to be called back in timer_ticks (each timer_tick is 1/10th second).
	the cookie value is passed to your callback function.  The callback is only triggered
	once.  If you need a repeated callback, the callback can re-register itself to be
	called again.

register_proximity_callback(callback, oid1, oid2, distance); -- when the objects
	indicated by oid1 and oid2 are within the specified distance of one another,
	the specified callback is called passing the two object ids.

	Example:

	function mycallback(oid1, oid2, distance)
		print "Player has come within 300 of starbase_x\n";
        end

	register_proximity_callback("mycallback", player_ids[1], starbase_x, 300);

get_player_damage(id, system); -- returns value of damage to player ship system.
	id is the id of the player's ship (see get_player_ship_ids() above.)
	system is the name of the system for which you want damage info, and must be one of:
        "shields", "impulse" "warp", "maneuvering", "phaser", "sensors", "comms", "tractor"
	The returned value is between 0 (no damage) and (255) max damage, inclusive. 
	nil is returned on error (e.g. bad system, bad id, etc.)

set_player_damage(id, system, value) -- sets the damage of the specified system of the
		specified player.  Id is the id of the player ship, system is the name
		of the system to damage (see get_player_damage() above.)

load_skybox(ship_id, filenameprefix) -- loads a new skybox composed of six images for any clients
	with specified ship id that have the role of main screen.  If filenameprefix is
	the string "x", then the six images are x0.png, x1.png, x2.png, x3.png, x4.png, and
	x5.png. These must reside in ${SNIS_ASSET_DIR} (by default, share/snis/textures).
	If the value "restore-default" is passed as the filenameprefix, then the default
	skybox for the current solarsystem is loaded.

ux,uy,uz = user_coords(x, y, z) -- returns user (player) coordinates given program coordinates.
	(this really just swaps y and z. ux == x, uy == z, uz == y).

ai_push_patrol(id, nwaypoints, x, y, z, x2, y2, z2, x3, y3, z3, ... )
	set up a patrol route (up to 5 waypoints) for ship with specified id.

ai_push_attack(attacker_id, victim_id)
	make a ship attack something else

set_faction(object_id, faction_id) -- sets the specified object's faction to the specified
	faction.  Clears the object's ai stack.

show_timed_text(id, time_in_seconds, textstring);
	shows a text screen with the given textstring for the specified amount of time
	on all clients of the bridge for the given player ship id.  If id is -1, then
	the message is displayed on all clients of all bridges.

show_menu(id, menustring, callback_function);
	shows a menu defined by menustring to players aboard the ship with the specified id,
	and calls callback_function, passing the selection made by the user.  The menu is
	defined by a multiline string. The first line is used as the title of the menu, and
	subsequent lines define the menu items.  There is a maximum of 10 menu items.  The
	callback will be passed an integer between 0 and 9 indicating which item was selected.

	Example:

	function my_menu_callback(shipid, selection)
		print("========================= Player ", shipid, " has chosen ", selection, "\n");
        end

	player_ids = get_player_ship_ids();
	show_menu(player_ids[1],
			"MY MENU\n" ..
			"ITEM 1\n" ..
			"ITEM 2\n" ..
			"ITEM 3\n" ..
			"ITEM 4\n" ..
			"ITEM 5\n" ..
			"ITEM 6\n" ..
			"ITEM 7\n" ..
			"ITEM 8\n" ..
			"ITEM 9\n" ..
			"ITEM 0\n",
			"my_menu_callback");

enqueue_lua_script(scriptname);
	Queue the named lua script for execution;

get_ship_attribute(id, attribute_name); -- returns the specified attribute of the ship.  The
	type depends on the attribute, though generally will be a number or a string.

	The attributes and their types are listed below (output of print_ship_attributes program):
	The types are as follows (from key_value_parser.h):

	's' - string
	'q' - number (uint64_t)
	'w' - number (uint32_t)
	'h' - number (uint16_t)
	'b' - number (uint8_t)
	'Q' - number (int64_t)
	'W' - number (int32_t)
	'H' - number (int16_t)
	'B' - number (int8_t)
	'd' - number (double)
	'f' - number (float)

	Though, to lua, they're all just "numbers."

	The attributes are as follows:

                                     Key Type     offset       size      index
                                       x    d         96          8          0

	Example usage:

	player_ids = get_player_ship_ids();

	ship_name = get_ship_attribute(player_ids[1], "sdata.name");

get_commodity_name(index); -- This field allows you to get the names of cargo bay items.
  Returns the name of the commodity associated with the given index.  The commodities are
  initially defined by the contents of share/snis/commodities.txt.  The name is the first
  field in each line this file.  You get the index value via calling for example
  get_ship_attribute(shipid, "cargo[0].contents.item"), which returns you a number.
  get_commodity_name() decodes this number into a name.  See the example for
  get_commodity_units(), below.

get_commodity_units(index); -- This field allows you to get the units of cargo bay items.
  Returns the units of the commodity associated with the given index.  The commodities are
  initially defined by the contents of share/snis/commodities.txt.  The units is the second
  field in each line this file.  You get the index value via calling for example
  get_ship_attribute(shipid, "cargo[0].contents.item"), which returns you a number.  get_commodity_units()
  decodes this number into a string defining the units.

  Example:

	player_ids = get_player_ship_ids();
	cargo = get_ship_attribute(player_ids[1], "cargo[0].contents.item");
	cargo_name = get_commodity_name(cargo);
	cargo_units = get_commodity_units(cargo);

lookup_commodity(commodity_name); -- returns the index of a named commodity, or nil
	if there is no commodity with the specified name.  The name is not case
	sensitive.

  Example:

	n = lookup_commodity("gold ore");

set_commodity_contents(object_id, commodity_index, quantity, cargo_bay_number) -- sets
	the contents of a player ship's cargo bay or a cargo container to the specified
	item and quantity.  If the object_id refers to a cargo container, the cargo_bay_number is
	ignored and may be omitted.  If the object_id refers to a player ship, the
	cargo_bay_number should be between 0 and 7 inclusive.  0.0 is returned on success,
	nil on failure.

  Example:

	my_container = add_cargo_container(1000, 1000, 1000, 0, 0, 0);
	player_ids = get_player_ship_ids();
	n = lookup_commodity("gold ore");
	set_commodity_contents(player_ids[1], n, 100.0, 0);
	set_commodity_contents(my_container, n, 100.0);

add_commodity(name, unit, scans_as, base_price, volatility, legality,
		econ_sensitivity, govt_sensitivity, tech_sensitivity,
		odds);
  Adds a new commodity to the predefined set of commodities.  This is useful for
  custom scenarios to create special "macguffins".   If the odds are set to zero, then
  the game will never randomly generate the item, and it is up to the script to place
  it into the game.  See share/snis/commodities.txt for an explanation of the
  parameters.

  Example:

	macguffin = add_commodity("flux capacity", "gigawatts", "tachyon flux" 100.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
	my_container = add_cargo_container(1000, 1000, 1000, 0, 0, 0);
	player_ids = get_player_ship_ids();
	n = lookup_commodity("gold ore");
	set_commodity_contents(player_ids[1], macguffin, 100.0, 0);
	set_commodity_contents(my_container, macguffin, 100.0);

reset_player_ship(player_ship_id) -- resets the player ship to healthy status with all
	systems turned off.  Most useful at the beginning of mission scripts.

  Example:

	player_ids = get_player_ship_ids();
	reset_player_ship(player_ids[1]);

add_turret(parent_id, x, y, z, firing_interval) -- adds a turrent onto the specified
	object at the specified offset with specified firing interval (10ths of secs).

  Example:
	turret_id = add_turret(starbase_id, 100, 100, 0);

add_block(parent_id, x, y, z, sx, sy, sz, rotx, roty, rotz, angle, material_index, form);
	Adds a "block" into the universe at the specified location (or relative location
	if parent_id >= 0) and size, with specified orientation and material.

	x, y, z:
		if parent_id is -1, then x, y, z indicate the position to add the block.
		if parent_id is >= 0, then parent_id is the ID of a parent object, and x, y, z
		denote the relative position the block is added onto the parent object.
	sx, sy, sz:
		These denote the dimensions of the block in three axes
	rotx, roty, rotz, angle:
		These specify an axis and an angle about which to rotate the block.
		The angle is in radians.  If you do not want any rotation, use: 1, 0, 0, 0
		If you want 45 degrees about the X axis, use 1, 0, 0, 45.0 * 3.145927 / 180.0
	material_index:
		This chooses a texture for the block.  There are currently two choices, 0 and 1.
		Anything else is invalid.  0 is suitable for larger blocks, 1 for smaller blocks.
	form:
		0.0: block form is a "block" (i.e. a rectangular solid).
		1.0: block form is a sphere. The maximum of sx, sy, and sz is used for all
		  three. The sphere cannot be non-uniformly scaled in x,y and z, scaling must
		  be uniform in all three axes. This is because collision detection for an
		  ellipsoid is too difficult. See for example:
		  https://www.geometrictools.com/Documentation/DistancePointEllipseEllipsoid.pdf
		  I have not implemented that algorithm, so we've got spheres, not ellipsoids.
		  The sphere will by cylindrically texture mapped with the Z axis corresponding
		  to the long axis of the cylinder.
		2.0: block form is a capsule (cylinder with hemispheres at the end).
		  The length of the cylinder is sx, and the radius is max(sy, sz).

	Returns the ID of the created block.

	Note: if the parent_id < 0, then the block will be given a random rotational
	velocity.

  Example:

	block = add_block(-1, 1000, 1000, 1000, 50, 100, 50, 1, 0, 0, 45 * 3.1415927 / 180.0, 0);
	subblock = add_block(block, 10, 20, 10, 20, 20, 20, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0);

add_turrets_to_block_face(parent_id, face, rows, cols)
	Adds an array of rows * cols turrets onto one of the faces of a block;

	if parent_id is invalid, -1 is returned and nothing is done.

	face is a number betwee 0 and 5 inclusive indicating which face of the block
	to add the turret array.

	0 - positive x face
	1 - negative x face
	2 - positive y face
	3 - negative y face
	4 - positive z face
	5 - negative z face

	face is forced in range by "face = fabs(face) % 6".

	rows and cols indicate the size of the turret array to add.

  Example:
	block = add_block(-1, 1000, 1000, 1000, 500, 500, 500, 1, 0, 0, 45 * 3.1415927 / 180.0, 0);
	add_turrets_to_block_face(block, 1, 2, 3);

attach_science_text(id, text)
	Adds a string of up to 256 characters to the object with the specified ID. This text
	will be displayed on the science screen when the object is scanned. This allows for
	scenarios to inject arbitrary (fictional) content into the game via the science console.
	For example, you might attach "This asteroid contains a high proportion of crystalline
	kryptonite", to an asteroid object, and then this would be displayed when the object is
	scanned by science.

add_explosion(x, y, z, v, nsparks, time, victim_type, explosion_type);
	Adds an explosion into the simulation with (nsparks) sparks, traveling at
	velocity related to (v), lasting (time) ticks (30th sec). Victim type
	should be a small integer (see the #defines for OBJTYPE_... in snis.h:
	Typically use OBJTYPE_SHIP2 (1) or the type of the thing which is exploding,
	if there is such a thing (see below). victim_type is used to decide whether
	or not there should be debris mixed in with the sparks. explosion_type should
	be 0 (regular explosion) or 1 (black hole explosion). The former has orange
	sparks and is spherical in shape, the latter has greenish sparks and is much
	larger and has a non-spherical shape.

dock_player_to_starbase(player_id, starbase_id)
	Docks the player with an empty docking port on the specified starbase.
	returns -1.0 on failure, 0.0 on success. May fail if all docking ports
	are full or if the player id or starbase id are not correct.

x,y,z,id = get_mining_bot_destination(id)
	Returns the current coordinates of the mining bots destination and the id
	of that destination if the destination is an object (not a waypoint), or nil
	if the id is inappropriate or if the mining bot is not deployed.

NOTE: Your lua scripts must not sleep, call any function which blocks, or require excessive
long running calculations (nothing more than a few hundredths of a second) because the lua
scripts are called from the main thread and if the scripts block, the entire game will block.
