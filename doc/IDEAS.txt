Here be ideas about what might or might not be added into the game
at some point.

I wonder if it might be possible to leverage ffmpeg to make a quick and dirty
implementation of the typical star trek video call from bridge to bridge.  For
example, this will record video to stdout, rapidly encoded suitable for
streaming (I think):

ffmpeg -f v4l2 -i /dev/video0 -f pulse -i default -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a aac -b:a 128k -f flv -

Could use popen() read from that, blast it to snis_server, snis_server could
blast it to a remote client, and vice versa, and voila, a video call is
implemented.

There are C APIs too, if quick and dirty is not quick enough or too dirty,

Currently we have nine solarsystems defined, requiring 550M in PNG assets:

$ du -h
86M	./zaurno
71M	./varco
50M	./tau-scorpii
89M	./karado
53M	./zolon
53M	./sirius
41M	./polaris
32M	./default
77M	./quidgebo
550M	.

(On that front, what if we switched to a different image format, like JPEG
or QOI or something... could drastically cut down on the size as PNGs aren't small.

How could we get more solarsystems without more assets? We could have ephemeral
(or fake, or some other descriptor) solarsystems without assets, which either
re-use the existing assets, possibly modifying colors via shaders, or maybe
develop some procedural shaders or on-the-fly asset generation fast enough for
warp gate travel (How? Not easy.)  This would allow for a greatly expanded
universe (though maybe a not very interesting universe).  Maybe we don't need
such a thing.

----------------------------

Might be a good idea to add ipv6 support. In some places, ipv4 from ISPs is apparently
somewhat scarce and expensive (e.g. Brazil) and this situation is not likely to improve
for ipv4 with time. Plus, it might just be an interesting problem to work on.  snis_server,
ssgl_server, and snis_multiverse would have to support both ipv4 and ipv6 concurrently.
Clients could, I suppose be ipv4 or ipv6. Not sure if it makes sense for snis_client to be
both ipv4 and ipv6, using one or the other with different snis_servers.  I think not.
I think the snis_client should probably be ipv4 XOR ipv6, decided at initialization,
either by user choice, or by what interfaces are configured (i.e. if there is only an
ipv6 interface then use ipv6.)

snis_text_window...  the text should be cut-and-pasteable with the mouse.
This shouldn't be too hard.  We know where the text is displayed, and we know
where the mouse is.  Drag events can copy the text to a buffer. Some code around
here might be instructive:
https://github.com/smcameron/gneutronica/blob/master/gneutronica.c#L1198

It should be possible to turn on logging of the client and server consoles,
so whatever is in the console is logged to stderr/stdout as well.

In earthlike, instead of craters deforming the height map, how about
deforming the normalmap directly? I think this might solve the
overlapping crater problem.

** SHIP UPGRADES? **

At starbases, you could upgrade your ship.  Ship
upgrades could be accomplished by initially depriving the ship of
various modules on the DAMAGE CONTROL screen, which could be bought.
It might also be possible to start the ship off with only a single
laser cannon (instead of current dual laser cannons) and no torpedo
system (Damage control, again), which could be upgraded at starbases
for money.  Maybe even add a second weapons turret (requiring another
player to man it) on the bottom of the ship for a price.

Allow comms to try to extort NPC ships to release their cargo, pay tribute,
or... something like that.  Allow transfer of funds between player ships.
*maybe* funds transfer between NPC ships and player ships. (what about
derelicts -- perhaps bearer bonds might be found aboard, or... something?)

*** CHECKPOINT RESTART

Some way to checkpoint the universe state and restart it.  This is
hard for two reasons:  player state, and lua state. The lua state is
the harder of the two.  Lua essentially makes this impossible to do
without some sort of wizard level fuckery.

*** PIRATE SHIPS

Ships could have a pirate mode in which they apprehend other ships (incl. player
ships) and demand they eject cargo. They could have a bomb they attach to the
ship which they detonate if the victim does not comply (or just shoot them). The
pirate ships could band together in a fleet to have more firepower. Q: How does
the player escape from attached bomb without giving up cargo? (Bomb model could be
implemented via BLOCK_FORM_CAPSULE).

Ships could have some history and have captains with some proc gen history, and
be "registered" at particular planets, etc. Captains/ships could be "wanted" in
various planets a la Elite. (partially implemented -- some ships have bounties now).

Maybe player ships can engage in piracy as well, having some way to hail ships
and demand cargo ejection, maybe be able to use the mining robot to plant a bomb
on other ships?


*** AWAY TEAM(S) ***

1. COMMS could summon a team led by an NPC, "Cmdr. Winston," or whatever
   to the transporter room.

2. Science could select an object, or a planet + longitude + latitude
   and beam the away team down to the planet.

3. Science's chosen longitude and latitude could show up on the planet
   surface in navigation.

4. Beam up/down only works if the ship is near to the lat+long.

5. Comms can communicate with the away team (similar to mining bot, I guess.)

6. Away team has "transponders" that have string "IDs" that you can "lock on to"
   to beam them up/down.

7. Away team can put these transponders onto cargo containers
   that can then be beamed up/down.

8. Lua scripts can act as the away team, sending/receiving comms to do things
   (similar to the robot in STURNVULF mission.)

9. Maybe away team could be beamed to other ships or to starbases to do stuff.

10. Science could have sliders to select longitude/latitude and the targeted
    area can be highlighted on globe on science and on navigation.  maybe
    extra scanning info (e.g. transponder tags?  Minerals?  lifeforms?
    macguffins?)

11. Away teams could be killed or lost, or left behind, or bring passengers
    aboard.

12. NPC "away teams" could contact the ship (via comms) from the planet surface
    requesting to be beamed aboard, or whatever.

13. Need to write some Lua mission using these ideas to see what could be done.

*** Build starbases out of blocks ***

Currently, starbases are each made of a single model (STL or OBJ), with some docking
ports (also a single model) glued onto them.  There is no real collision detection
between ships (player or non-player) and the starbases (apart from the docking ports).

Starbases could be built out of "blocks" (OBJTYPE_BLOCK), though the blocks would
have to be improved and more types of blocks would need to be added.  Currently
blocks only have one of two textures, and there are only a few types of blocks
(cuboid, sphere and capsule).  Would need to allow more textures, and more shapes
(cylinder and ring, at least.) This would allow proper collision detection between
the player ship and the starbases, and allow for more elaborate and larger
starbases.  For collision detection of new shapes, take a look at
https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions/ of course.

Alternately (and probably better), starbases could be modeled in the usual way,
but supplemented with "invisible blocks" used only for collision deteciton
(this type of thing is called a "collider", in other engines, I think).

It would be nice if there were a better way to construct composite objects of
multiple blocks than what we have now.  What we have now is very primitive,
cumbersome, and mentally taxing... see share/snis/luascripts/MISSIONS/BIGSHIP.LUA
for example.
