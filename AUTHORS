Space Nerds In Space was written by 
Stephen M. Cameron - <smcameron@users.sourceforge.net>

Some of the audio code was modelled very loosely on
some test programs that come with portaudio (e.g. 
callback prototype.).

And, ogg_to_pcm.c is just a hacked version of
oggdec.c from vorbistools, by Michael Smith <msmith@xiph.org>

rumble.h and rumble.c borrow heavily from Johann Deneux's fftest.c
