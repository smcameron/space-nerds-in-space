snis_multiverse is a meta-server process for the game Space Nerds In Space, which is
a multiplayer starship bridge simulator.  The meta-server process tracks player
ships between instances of the server process.  It is what enables player ships
to travel from one snis_server instance to another, possibly on a different host.
The "gameinstance" parameter is used by the game lobby
process (ssgl_server) to distinguish one game instance from another running
on the same host.
The gameinstance should be a short human readable string to uniquely identify
the game instance.  The serverhost is the hostname of the server hosting the
ssgl_multiverse process.  The location is a human readable string giving some idea
of the location of the server, or some other descriptive information.
